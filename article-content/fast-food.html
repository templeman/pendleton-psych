<p>Almost everyone is aware of the health problems with fast food, but
now Canadian researchers demonstrate how mere reminders of fast food can
make us hurry and become impatient. In their first experiment Chen-Bo
Zhong and Sanford DeVoe of the University of Toronto instructed 57
college students to read a short paragraph unrelated to fast food and
type it on a computer. Next they were told to keep their focus on the
center of the computer screen and ignore images of objects that flashed
briefly in the corners. Hidden in these images were either blank squares
or logos of fast food restaurants, including KFC, McDonalds, Taco Bell,
Burger King, Wendy’s, and Subway.	Although all the students reported
noticing the objects in the corners of the screen, none of them detected
the fast food logos, which were shown too briefly (roughly 80
milliseconds) to reach consciousness. Next they were asked to read two
unrelated passages in a row, and the researchers measured the time it
took to read the first one.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Controlling for individual differences in
initial reading time, those students who were exposed to the fast food
logos read the second passage on average 15 seconds faster than the other
students. These results suggest that even unconscious exposure to fast
food cues may cause us to speed up what we’re doing, even when there is
no time pressure.</p>

<p>The second experiment looked at the effect of exposure to fast food
cues on preferences for time-saving products. First, an independent group
of students rated various household products, including shampoos (2 in 1
versus regular), detergents (high efficiency versus regular), skin care
solutions (3 in 1 versus regular), and toasters (4 slice versus single
slice), on time efficiency. Next 91 students were divided into two
groups: one was instructed to recall a time when they had eaten at a fast
food restaurant, and the other was instructed to recall a time when they
had gone grocery shopping. All students then completed a “marketing
survey” rating the desirability of the previous household products.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Those students who had recalled eating in a
fast food restaurant on average gave higher ratings to the “time
efficient” products than did those who had just thought about going
grocery shopping.</p>

<p>The last experiment examined the impact of fast food exposure on
delaying gratification. Fifty-eight students were randomly sorted into
two groups. One group was instructed to rate the “aesthetics” of two fast
food logos (McDonalds and KFC); the other rated the aesthetics of logos
of two inexpensive local diners where the service was known to be slower.
Next both groups participated in a decision task in which they made a
series of choices between receiving a fixed amount of money ($3.00)
immediately or a higher amount ranging from $3.05 to $7.00 one week
later. Can you guess which group was more likely to want the hard cash
right now?</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Those students exposed to the fast food
logos chose higher later dollar amounts than the other students before
they would give up the immediate $3.00. In other words, for the “fast
food group” it took a higher amount of money promised later to offset the
$3 offered immediately.</p>

<p>So what are the implications of this research for people in general?
It would seem that reminders of fast food are enough to make us hurry up
in other activities (even reading), choose more time saving products, and
make it harder for us to delay gratification.  Certainly such reminders
are everywhere, from newspaper ads to television commercials to neon
signs up and down our streets. If the influence of these signs and
symbols is really that widespread, are we more impatient ordering food
from McDonalds than say at a fancy sit-down restaurant? Do we speed up
driving by a KFC? Is the effect on people who eat fast food regularly
greater than on those who rarely do “take-out”? It would also be
interesting to study the influence of other time saving logos, like
Sprint or Apple, on our daily behavior. Would they have the same pull for
impatience and instant gratification? Finally, it is also unclear how
long these effects last. Do we slow down and take our time when not
reminded of fast food? It might be interesting to take note of your own
behavior around fast food next time you pull into the Drive-Thru.</p>

<p>If mere exposure to fast food symbols can influence our behavior, what
other influences push and pull us in little ways every day? A recent
study by researchers at the University of Michigan surveying attitudes
about health risks found that if the surveyor merely sneezed before
asking the questions, the respondents estimated higher risks of
contracting a serious disease. Another recent study by researchers at
Columbia University found that having a female experimenter merely pat
the participants on the shoulder caused them to take unusually high
financial risks in an investment game.</p> 

<p>What sorts of things influence your day to day behavior? If you’re
interested, here’s an experiment you can do. It’s called mindfulness.
Pick a random day out of your week and observe your own reactions to the
little things going on around you. Take some notes. Pay attention to
changes in your speed (fast or slow), your tension level (high or low),
mood (up or down), response to people (open or closed), and of course
your thoughts. At the same time note what is going on around you, even
subtle things, like what you’re looking at, who’s around you, overheard
conversations, other sounds, even temperature and weather. If you detect
an influence of some kind, see if you can counter it by focusing on
something else or consciously making yourself “go the other way.” You
just may find yourself a fascinating subject.</p>
