<p>What is it with dogs and people? Of all the domesticated animals, dogs
are more likely to be chosen by humans as companions. Some people even
think of them as their best friends, give them special names, confide in
them, and write them into their wills. Dogs of course were bred over many
generations to be useful to humans, for such things as hunting, herding,
and protection, but few people in this modern age still rely on dogs for
their practical utility. So why are we still so attached to them? Recent
research on the relationship between humans and dogs is beginning to
provide some answers.</p>

<p>Much of this research has been done at the Research Institute for
Psychology in Bucharest, Hungary, where a fascinating series of studies
has shown some unique mental capacities of dogs. For example, dogs are
much better at making eye contact with their human owners than other
types of pets. They also share attention; that is, if the owner looks
away and points at an object the dog will actually look at where the
person is pointing, unlike other creatures such as cats, wolves, or even
monkeys. Dogs are also more likely to imitate the actions of their owners
and follow verbal commands than other animals.</p>

<p>In one set of experiments published recently dogs were trained to
retrieve an object placed behind a barrier (Location A) by their human
trainer. After several retrievals from behind Location A the trainer then
put the object behind an adjacent barrier (Location B). When the trainer
told the dog to fetch, where do you think it went? If you picked Location
B, you would be wrong. The dogs most often went back to Location A, where
they had seen the object hidden many times. When the same experiment was
performed with wolves (who had been raised by humans), the wolves went to
Location B and correctly found the hidden object. So what’s going on with
dogs?</p> 

<p>It turns out the dogs were acting more like humans, at least very
young humans, than they were like wolves. Infants 10 months old or
younger will also try to look for an object where it was placed
frequently even if they see someone place it in a different place. This
phenomenon has been called the Object Permanence Effect. It suggests that
humans and dogs have the capacity to learn rules about where things are
supposed to go, whereas wolves (and other animals) just pay attention to
where things are put each time. As human babies get a little older (12
months) they are able to look beyond the rule and see that the object is
in a new place. Dogs however stick to the rule.</p>

<p>That is, until someone new moves the object. In a follow-up experiment
dogs and infants were trained to fetch (or just look for) an object
hidden in Location A, then after several trials a new person put the
object behind Location B. Ten month old infants continued to look at
Location A but dogs switched and fetched from Location B. Why were the
dogs smarter than the babies? The researchers suggest that dogs are very
attentive to their human trainers, so that who is doing what is much more
important to them than what is being learned.</p>

<p>Other experiments also reflect this canine attachment to humans. One
involved owners bringing their dogs into a room where a dish of tasty
food sat in the corner. As the dog approached the dish the experimenter
played a recording of another dog growling. The dog immediately backed
away and looked at its owner, as if asking for help. Barking is another
means of communicating – not with other dogs but with their owners. Dogs
have a much broader variety of barks than other canids such as wolves,
and experiments have shown that dog owners are very adept at identifying
the meaning of each type of barking. Thus it appears that dogs have been
bred to communicate with their human masters much more than with other
dogs. Think about that the next time you walk past a barking dog!</p>
