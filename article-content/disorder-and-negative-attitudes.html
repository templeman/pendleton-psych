<p>How much do our physical surroundings affect our attitudes toward
others? For years sociologists, psychologists, and political scientists
have known that signs of disorder and chaos in neighborhoods and
communities increase lawlessness and lead to more disorder. Such research
has led to public efforts to clean up graffiti, trash, and run-down
buildings as a way to fight crime. But how does a disorderly environment
affect people in general? A recent series of studies by researchers in
The Netherlands suggests that environmental disorder promotes
stereotyping and even discrimination against minority groups.</p>

<h4>Study #1</h4>
<p>In Study #1 people were interviewed in a busy train
station in Utrecht during a strike by the janitors. The station had not
been cleaned for many days and was becoming rather seedy. The researchers
stopped passersby in the station and asked them to complete a brief
questionnaire about the character traits of three groups: Muslims,
homosexuals, and the Dutch. Those who agreed to the study were directed
to a line of chairs where they could fill out the questionnaire. One of
the chairs was occupied either by a white Dutch person or a black Dutch
person. Once the strike was over and the train station cleaned up, the
same experiment was repeated with different passersby.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Respondents in the dirty train station endorsed
more stereotyped character traits for the three groups than did
respondents in the clean train station. Furthermore, they tended to sit
farther away from the non-white person when the train station was dirty
than when it was clean.</p>

<h4>Study #2</h4>
<p>Study #2 was conducted in an affluent neighborhood. Passersby were
given the same character trait questionnaire as in Study #1, but for half
of them the neighborhood was altered to look disorderly (some tiles were
pulled out of the sidewalk, a car was parked half on the sidewalk, an
abandoned looking bicycle was lying nearby). After completing the
character survey, each respondent was also asked to contribute to a
“Money for Minorities” fund.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> As before, respondents in the disorderly
environment made more stereotyped judgments of the minorities and were
less inclined to give money to the Minorities Fund.</p> 

<h4>Study #3</h4>
<p>Study #3 was conducted with college students in a laboratory and was
designed to test whether some “need for order” underlies stereotyping.
Forty-seven students were shown either pictures of disorderly
environments (e.g., “a bookcase with chaotically stacked books”), orderly
scenes (bookcase with neatly shelved books), or neutral pictures, and
then asked to complete the same character trait questionnaire used in the
previous studies, plus a “need for structure” scale, with items like “I
need structure” and “I don’t like situations that are uncertain.”</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Stereotyping and need for structure were
highly correlated, and both were higher for students who had looked at
photos of disorder than for those who looked at the other photos.</p>

<h4>Study #4</h4>
<p>Study #4 involved a vigilance task requiring 57 students to keep their
eyes fixed on a point on a screen while a series of words were flashed to
the periphery so quickly the subjects had no conscious awareness of them.
One group was exposed to words associated with disorder (e.g., “chaos,
anarchy, mess”), one group to words associated with order (e.g.,
“structure, clarity, neat”), and one group to neutral words.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Those students exposed to the disorder words
scored higher on the measure of stereotyping and the need for structure
scale, and the two measures were highly correlated.</p>

<h4>Study #5</h4>
<p>Finally, Study #5 presented 66 students each with a page of abstract
symbols either chaotically placed or neatly arranged on a sheet of paper,
followed by the same character trait survey and need for structure
questionnaire.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Students exposed to the disorderly abstract
patterns scored higher on stereotyping and need for structure than did
students exposed to the neatly arranged symbols.</p>

<p>So what’s going on here? The authors conclude that disorder creates a
need for order, which leads to stereotyping groups in general and
discriminating against groups that aren’t like us as a way to regain some
sense of order. They found differences in attitudes about minorities not
only when the respondents took the questionnaires in a disorderly
environment but even when they were merely exposed to disorderly words,
pictures, and shapes! While such brief exposures may not be powerful
enough to create lasting attitudes, the fact that such effects could be
measured at all is pretty interesting and leads to other questions. For
example, if someone had to live in a disorderly environment for very
long, would it lead to more lasting changes in attitudes?	What about
people who grow up in a disorderly environment – would they experience
the same need for order as those who were used to order? In other words,
is it the disorder itself or the noticeable change from order to disorder
that causes the effect? If so, just how noticeable would it have to be to
affect attitude and behavior? What if just one thing was out of place?
Also, what if the passersby were offered some way to respond to the
disorder, such as tidying up the room or aligning the symbols neatly on
the page? Would their tendency to stereotype others be lessened? And what
about minority groups themselves – would they also be more inclined to
stereotype groups in a disorderly environment?</p>

<p>This research is similar to other studies demonstrating the
psychological effects of our surroundings on our daily lives. Recall the
What’s New in Psychology article <a href="fast-food">"Fast Food
	and Impatience"</a>, where people were found to hurry up and be more
impatient in the presence of fast food logos. Together these studies
suggest that our local environments can affect our thinking and actions
in ways so subtle we may not be aware of them. With these studies in
mind, it might be interesting to think of ways your surroundings
influence you as you go through your day.</p>
