<h5>Terrel L. Templeman, Ph.D.</h5>
<p>Anxiety is a psychological state that everyone feels from time to
time. Like most other species humans are biologically wired to react
to potential threats in their environment. Imagine a cat curled up in
a room. Now imagine a door opening and a large dog entering the room,
spotting the cat and charging it, teeth bared and growling. The cat
reacts by leaping out of the dog’s way, or if cornered, baring its
fangs and claws and hissing, the classic <span class="keyword">Flight
	or Fight</span> response, which we humans label <span
	class="keyword">fear</span>.  Now suppose someone collars the dog,
takes it away, and shuts the door.  Eventually the cat calms itself
and lies back down, but something inside the cat has changed.  It
likely will not drop into as deep a sleep as before.  It becomes
vigilant, looking at the door, more attentive to sounds.  It may
startle if the door opens, jumping away even before looking to see if
there is a dog.  Even if the dog is gone, it may take a while for the
cat’s internal state to return to the same resting level it was in
before the dog first appeared.  Even though the cat can’t tell us how
it’s feeling, we would likely say it has become <span
	class="keyword">anxious</span> about staying in the room.</p>

<p>Now imagine yourself quietly sitting in a room.  Imagine a door 
opening and a large dog charging toward you, teeth bared and growling. 
Your reaction in many ways will be similar to that of the cat.  Your 
heart rate will quicken, blood pressure go up, breathing accelerate, 
you will look for cover or prepare to fight off the dog.  Like the 
cat, you are now in a <span class="keyword">Flight or Fight</span> 
mode.  After the dog leaves it 
will take you a while to calm down, even with the door closed.  Indeed 
it may be difficult for you to sit comfortably in that same room again 
for some time, and it is this state of anticipation that we call 
<span class="keyword">anxiety</span>.  Indeed, you may decide to never
again go back to that room.</p>

<p>The example above illustrates some of the basic components of a 
fear response that is at the root of all anxiety.  What are these 
components?</p>

<h4>Physical Arousal</h4>
<p>The physical symptoms of anxiety include faster breathing, 
increased heart rate, and muscle tension – reactions that prepare us 
to flee.  Beyond this <span class="keyword">Flight or Fight</span> 
response is a feeling of dread, which can produce light-headedness, 
dizziness, feeling flushed or hot, difficulty breathing or swallowing, 
and a feeling of unreality.  Some people also get headaches and upset 
stomachs, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, or even diarrhea.</p>

<h4>Fearful Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although we can’t read the cat’s mind, human beings think in very
predictable ways when they become anxious.  Their thoughts usually
take the form of either  <span class="keyword">What if…</span> or
<span class="keyword">Have to…</span>  <span class="keyword">What if
</span> thoughts anticipate some threat or dreadful occurrence that
might happen in the future.  <span class="keyword">Have to</span>
thoughts direct us to do something to ward off the threat and make
ourselves safe.</p>

<h4>Escape and Avoidance</h4>
<p>Just like the cat our first reaction to any perceived threat is to
flee or escape.  This is a natural fear response.  Anxiety however
goes beyond fleeing an immediate threat to focus our attention on
future threats.  Unlike the cat that may keep its eye on the door for
a while and then go back to sleep, human beings have an enormous
capacity to imagine all kinds of scenarios involving that door and
what may happen to threaten or endanger us in the future.  Persons
with anxiety disorders don’t simply keep an eye open for danger, they
actively avoid situations that might be threatening.</p> 

<h3>Anxiety Disorders</h3> 
<p>So what is an anxiety disorder?  Anxiety Disorders have four
essential components:</p> 

<ol>
	 <li>A strong sense of threat.</li>
	<li>Physical arousal which is so intense it feels
	overwhelming.</li>
	<li>Preoccupation with the perceived threat, which disrupts our 
	thinking about anything else.</li>
	 <li>Avoidance of anything associated with the threat.</li>
	<li>The combination of physical arousal, preoccupation with threat, 
	and avoidance are severe enough to interfere with leading a normal, 
	productive life.</li>
</ol>

<p>All anxiety disorders involve the same components but in different 
combinations and intensities.  Some persons are more prone to anxiety 
disorders than the general population because they experience more 
<span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> than others.  Others may 
be naturally more ruminative than the general population and when 
anxious engage in more <span class="keyword">fearful thoughts</span>. 
Some situations would naturally make anyone anxious for a while, but 
those people who are more easily aroused or more ruminative are more 
likely to experience the disruptive effects of anxiety and thus are 
at greater risk for anxiety disorders.  Anxiety disorders tend to run 
in families and clearly have a genetic component to them. They are 
also related to other emotional disorders, such as depression, 
suggesting a central role for emotional activation in both disorders. 
People who are anxious are more likely to become depressed.
</p>

<p>Below is a description of common anxiety disorders using the 
components listed above.</p>

<h4>Phobias</h4>
<p>The most common type of anxiety disorder is the simple phobia.  At
sometime in their lives, about 11% of the U.S. population will
experience a simple phobia.  Phobias consist of fears of particular
objects or situations.  Common phobias include fears of heights,
animals, needles, and flying.  Having to face these situations creates
high <span class="keyword">physical arousal</span>, but phobias are
primarily maintained by <span class="keyword">avoidance</span>.  Take
snakes for example.  Persons who fear snakes not only avoid contacts
with the slithery reptiles but also avoid going places where they
might come in contact with one (e.g., the woods, the reptile house at
zoos).  They even avoid depictions of snakes (pictures, movies) and
dislike talking about them.  Avoiding snakes keeps the fear high, and
when snake phobics accidentally come across one in the backyard they
are likely to freak out or panic.</p>

<h4>Social Phobia</h4>
<p>At some point in their lifetimes about 13% of the U.S. population 
will fear going out in public.  Few people seek treatment for this 
phobia because they find ways to avoid being around people.  Social 
phobics often find occupations that allow them to avoid going out, and 
when they do go out they make an effort not to draw attention to 
themselves.  In addition to just being around people, social phobics 
also fear being “put on the spot” and having to speak in front of 
others, which is sometimes called public speaking anxiety.  As with 
other types of phobias, when having to face a social gathering social 
phobics experience high <span class="keyword">physical arousal</span>, 
but because it is almost impossible to completely avoid interacting 
with other people, social phobics also spend a lot of their waking 
time in <span class="keyword">fearful thoughts</span> anticipating 
these interactions.</p>

<h4>Panic Disorder</h4>
<p>Panic attacks occur when <span class="keyword">physical arousal
</span> becomes so intense the person experiencing it feels out of 
control.  Such attacks are fairly common in the general population.  
Over one-third of the general population experiences at least one 
panic attack in any given year.  Such attacks are sometimes referred 
to as anxiety attacks.  They can occur almost anywhere.  Imagine you 
are rushing around in a store shopping.  Suddenly your heart starts 
pounding and you can’t catch your breath.  The store starts swirling 
around and you have to sit down.  The experience is scary, catches you 
off guard, and you wonder what just happened.  In a few minutes you 
feel calm enough to go on with your shopping.  You have just 
experienced a mild panic attack.  Here’s another example.  You are 
riding in a car on a winding road.  You’re in the back seat and after 
a while you start to feel light headed, dizzy and even a little 
nauseous.  You think you’re getting car sick.  The feeling is so 
intense you can’t make it go away.  You ask the driver to stop the car 
so you can calm down.  Even after the car stops you can’t stop shaking 
or get your heart to slow down.  In fact it may start to get worse, 
and you begin to feel out of control.  You worry that you might pass 
out!  Panic attack.  Or how about this example:  You are on a 
treadmill and really working hard, wanting to get a good workout.  The 
faster you go the more you can feel your heart beating.  Suddenly you 
feel like you’re moving too fast, your heart is really racing, and you 
start to feel a pain in your chest.  Are you having a heart attack?  
No, you’re having a panic attack.  Panic attacks can even occur in 
your sleep.  They are not necessarily associated with nightmares or 
even dreaming – some people just wake up in a sweat and heart 
pounding.  What does it mean?  Panic attack.</p>

<p>If these things happen to many people, do they all have panic 
disorder?  No.  <span class="keyword">Panic disorder occurs in those 
	people who become anxious about having panic attacks</span>.  The 
<span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> of the attack leads to 
<span class="keyword">fearful thoughts</span> about what is going on. 
Such people misinterpret the attack as something more threatening than 
it really is, such as a heart attack, a brain tumor, a seizure, or 
going crazy.  Merely thinking about having one heightens the fear for 
such people and may lead to <span class="keyword">agoraphobia</span>, 
which is the fear of going anywhere because you might have a panic 
attack in public.  Such persons stay home to feel safe.  Others are 
able to leave their homes but only under certain conditions that make 
them feel safe – they may always require someone to go with them, or 
they only go to certain places where they feel safe or go out at 
certain times of the day, or only remain away for brief periods of 
time to lower the chance of having a panic attack.  Panic Disorder 
occurs in about 3.5% of the U.S. population at sometime in their 
lifetimes.</p>

<h4>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</h4>
<p>OCD is primarily a disorder of <span class="keyword">repeated 
	fearful thoughts</span> (called <span class="keyword">obsessions
</span>) and attempts to ward off the thoughts (called 
<span class="keyword">compulsions</span>).  Obsessions demand 
attention and don’t seem to go away, no matter what the person does to 
make them go away.  They leave the sufferer in a constant state of 
dread and vigilance.  Common obsessions focus on germs or 
contamination, the possibility of being harmed or harming someone 
else, forgetting something important, or just “doing something wrong.” 
These ideas are so frightening they compel action to make them go 
away.  If the obsession is germs, the compulsion is to frequently 
clean, wipe, or wash whatever gets touched.  If the obsession is 
forgetting something or doing something wrong, the compulsion is 
checking to make sure nothing is forgotten, left behind, or to check 
over one’s work repeatedly.  Safety concerns often drive OCD, so one 
has to check doors to make sure they are locked, windows closed, plugs 
fastened tightly, appliances turned off, windows closed.  The fear of 
doing something wrong may cause one to repeatedly ask for reassurance 
- “Did I do that OK?” or to repeat a task many times to “make sure 
it’s right.”  The fear of not having something needed in the future 
leads to hoarding.  OCD can also lead to superstitious behaviors, such 
as tapping 3 times before opening a door, counting objects in a room 
or counting seconds when passing cars on the highway.  In such cases 
one may not even know what the dreaded consequence would be, but the 
<span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> is still high, and the 
person experiences it as a <span class="keyword">Fight or Flight
</span> situation.  OCD also produces 
<span class="keyword">avoidance</span> of situations that are 
associated with the obsession.  For example, an obsession about germs 
results in avoiding touching certain objects that might be 
“contaminated.”</p>

<p>Compulsions get locked in through a process called 
<span class="keyword">negative reinforcement</span>.  Any action that 
makes an uncomfortable feeling go away, even for a brief period, 
becomes a habit.  Let’s say you are prone to obsessive anxiety and you 
have to open a door.  You feel uneasy about it and for some reason 
think to count “1, 2, 3” before touching the knob.  Something about 
counting to 3 makes it a little easier to open the door, so the next 
time you come to a closed door you are going to be more likely to 
repeat the count: “1,2,3.”	 After a few times of doing this counting 
“1,2,3” becomes a habit you perform each time you encounter a closed 
door.  Once this habit gets locked in, not counting is no longer an 
option – counting to 3 is now a <span class="keyword">Have to</span>.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately compulsions don’t make the anxiety subside for very
long.  For example, consider the person who washes her hands right
after opening a door that may have germs on it.  As soon as she dries
her hands and turns to leave the washroom – guess what -- another door
to open!  Boom – <span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> is back
to high again.  If she opens that door she will be contaminated again,
and so will have to wash again.  Some persons with OCD try to prevent
this dilemma by carrying wipes or tissues with them wherever they go,
but despite these “precautions” the obsession with germs never goes
away and in fact gets worse.</p>

<p>Thus the OCD sufferer is plagued by both types of <span
	class="keyword">Fearful Thoughts</span> listed above:<br />  <span
	class="keyword">What if</span> thoughts which becomes obsessions,
and<br /> <span class="keyword">Have to</span> thoughts which become
compulsions.<br /> Persons with OCD try to keep their <span
	class="keyword">Physical Arousal</span> at bay through their
compulsive behavior, but they are in such a constant state of tension
that they are also prone to panic attacks.  Approximately one in 45
persons in the United States will develop OCD in their lifetimes.</p>

<h4>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h4>
<h4>(Worry)</h4>
<p> Worry occurs when you try to avoid an anxious thought.  Here’s an
example: Your son just got his driver’s license and can now drive
himself to visit friends.  One of these friends lives out in the
country.  Your son asks if he can drive out for the evening and
promises to be home by 10 pm.  He is a good driver and you have no
logical reason to say no, so he goes off.  About 9:30 pm it starts
raining.  You start thinking about how slick the roads can be in the
rain, how visibility is poor at night, which leads to thoughts about
deer that come out at night and wander onto country roads.  These
thoughts raise the possibility of a car accident, which causes your
mind to search for examples of teenage auto accidents.  You recall a
bad crash several years ago that killed a young couple driving home
from a party.  The image of slippery road, the sound of tires
screeching, the thought of his pickup being found upside down in a
----but wait! You don’t want to go there.  You are now in the realm of
<span class="keyword">fearful thoughts</span> so you try to stop
yourself from thinking about them, reassuring yourself that “nothing
is going to happen.” You try to put your mind on something else,
switch channels on the TV, pick up a magazine…..  But your mind goes
back to the thought, or perhaps an image of a wreck, and you begin to
doubt your own reassurance.  How can you be sure nothing’s going to
happen?  It’s happened before.  You read about it “all the time,” an
overturned pickup in an irrigation ditch --- “Now stop that!” you tell
yourself, “Focus on something else!”  So you do something to get busy,
balance the checkbook, get out the ironing board, pull up Solitaire on
the internet.  But it’s hard to focus because your mind continues to
slip back to the thought of that slippery road, an inexperienced
driver, the sudden appearance of a deer on the road.  You glance
anxiously at the clock and realize it’s already 10 o’clock and your
son is not home!  Now the <span class="keyword">physical
	arousal</span> begins to build, a sick feeling in the pit of your
stomach, and a strong feeling of dread that something horrible has
already happened.  You have to do something right now!  Maybe you
should call his cell phone.  But what if he’s driving home right now!
What if your call causes him to take his hands off the wheel for just
that split second and then….  Again you force yourself to think of
something else, maybe call the friend’s house and see if he is still
there.  This thought brings momentary relief – at least you’re doing
something, taking some action.  You make the call, the friend answers:
He tells you your son left a few minutes ago and should be home soon.
You hang up and look at the clock...</p>

<p>Let’s analyze this scenario.</p>

<ol>
	<li>This is your son’s first time driving off somewhere by himself,
	and it produces anxiety.  Note that this initial anxiety is common
	for most parents.</li>
	<li>The anxiety produces a <span class="keyword">What if</span>
	thought, which heightens the anxiety.</li>
	<li>You attempt to reduce anxiety by putting the <span
	class="keyword">what if</span> thought out of your mind before it
	becomes too frightening.</li>
	<li>The <span class="keyword">what if</span> thought intrudes on
	the distracter thought.</li>
	<li>You try again to <span class="keyword">avoid</span> the <span
	class="keyword">what if</span> thought.</li>
	<li>The <span class="keyword">what if</span> thought again
	intrudes, heightening anxiety by making you feel helpless.</li>
	<li>This cycle repeats itself several times, creating more <span
		class="keyword">physical arousal</span>, and making you feel
	more helpless.</li>
</ol>

<p>To put it succinctly, worry is the futile attempt to avoid a scary
thought.  In the same way that avoiding a phobia only makes a phobia
worse, avoiding scary thoughts only causes the thought to become more
frightening.</p>

<h4>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</h4>
<p>PTSD occurs following a traumatic event so terrifying you think you
are literally going to die.  It usually involves a very high degree of
<span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> and the <span
	class="keyword">Flight or Fight</span> response.  This reaction is
most likely to occur in situations that are actually dangerous, such
as natural disasters, combat, assaults, and accidents such as house
fires.  Auto accidents are the most common trauma associated with PTSD
in the United States.  PTSD was first identified in combat soldiers
who were so traumatized by their war experiences that they became
emotionally numb and unable to attend to events going on around them.
This slipping into another world (called <span
	class="keyword">dissociation</span>) is also common in other forms
of PTSD and represents a kind of <span class="keyword">mental
	avoidance</span>.  PTSD sufferers are also constantly on the
lookout for danger (called <span
	class="keyword">hypervigilance</span>) and startle easily.  They
engage in <span class="keyword">fearful thoughts</span> about what
happened to them, sometimes believing themselves to be marked as
future victims.  Consequently they are always in <span
	class="keyword">escape</span> mode, or in some cases <span
	class="keyword">fight</span> mode.</p>

<h3>Psychological Treatment of Anxiety Disorders</h3>
<p>The following treatment methods are based upon those of Joseph
Wolpe, Arnold Lazarus, David Barlow, Marsha Linehan, Steven Hayes, and
other psychologists.  The variations described below are mine.</p>

<h4>Managing Physical Arousal</h4>
<p>The first step to managing anxiety is learning how to physically calm
yourself down.  Taking a slow, deep breath (abdominal breathing), holding
it briefly and letting it out slowly allows your entire body to pause and
relax a bit.  By continuing to breathe slowly and deeply your heart rate
will also come down, as well as your blood pressure.  Using that pause to
be aware of muscle tension is also helpful.  Where are you feeling tight?
Your neck?  Shoulders?  Back?  Guts?  With each breath out, let go of the
tightness in those muscles.  Imagery may be helpful for some people.
Such images as ocean waves, rocking in a chair, lying in a hammock on a
summer day, or even just picturing yourself calming down and feeling more
relaxed, may actually direct your muscles to relax.  As you begin to feel
more in control physically, you can direct your attention to your
thoughts.  These steps work best when you first begin to feel anxious.
However, <span class="keyword">these steps do not work if you are already
	in the middle of a panic attack</span>.  (see below).  Rather than
waiting until you become anxious, practice slow breathing and muscle
relaxation in brief moments throughout the day, beginning when you first
wake up in the morning.  Before getting out of bed, take a moment to pay
attention to that first waking breath of the day, take it in and let it
out slowly.  As you get out of bed, stretch your limbs gently and
experience the flow of air down deep into your lungs.  If you go to work,
take another slow breath when you get in the car and before you turn on
the ignition.  It only takes a few seconds.  Do it again at random times
throughout the day, stretching if you need to let out some tightness.
These are brief, personal moments of calm, so momentary that no one else
will even notice you doing them.  Measuring your anxiety on a scale of 0
(none) to 10 (panic!) may also be helpful, as in the following
example:</p>

<img src="/image/anxiety-scale.gif" alt="anxiety scale" />

<p>Anxiety scales such as the one above provide you a gauge for
measuring physical arousal at various times during the day, so that
you become more aware of changes from calm to anxious.  On this scale
5 is the tipping point between getting back in control and slipping
out of control.  Once you feel yourself inching up toward a 5, it’s
time to slow yourself down, take a breath, consider your thoughts and
what you are doing (see Cognitive Approaches below).  If you suddenly
feel yourself in the upper half of the scale, again slow your
breathing, and challenge your fears.  Try not to leave the situation
you’re in until you get yourself back down below a 5.  <span
	class="keyword">Leaving a situation in a state of high anxiety 
	makes it more difficult to face the same situation
	again</span>.</p>

<p><strong>What to do if you are in a panic attack.</strong>
Remember, panic attacks involve very high physical arousal, often
pounding heart rate, rapid or choked up breathing, lightheadedness,
and even chest pain.  Believe it or not, the best response to a panic
attack that has already started is to <span class="keyword">just let
	it happen…..</span>	Slow breathing is not effective once a panic
attack really gets going, and if you try to fight it you will actually
make it worse, mainly because your efforts will tighten muscles and
speed up your breathing, which only contributes to the sensations you
are already feeling.  If you <span class="keyword">just ride with
	it</span> the panic will begin to subside all by itself.  Some
people ride it out by moving around to use up the adrenaline that is
surging through their bodies.  Jogging in place, jumping up and down,
or just pacing the floor will burn up some of the energy.  However,
such activity is impractical in certain situations.  If you are in a
crowded auditorium, attending a funeral, or in a closed door meeting
it is best to just sit through it and work on your fears.  Despite
feeling nauseous, it is unlikely you will actually vomit.  Likewise in
most cases you are not going to soil yourself, faint, or have a heart
attack (see Cognitive Approaches below).  The main thing to remember
about <span class="keyword">physical arousal</span> during a panic
attack is that it always subsides by itself if you don’t fight it.  It
does so because panic attacks are very exhausting and can’t sustain
themselves for long periods of time.  They are like running a race or
climbing a mountain – they wear you out.  In fact panic attacks are so
exhausting you may fall asleep after it’s over.</p>

<h4>Managing Frightening Thoughts</h4>
<p>It should be clear by now that where we direct our attention and
how we think about something are key to how we feel at any given
moment.  As a demonstration try this little exercise:  Think about
your seat right now.  Are you sitting on a soft couch or a hard 9
chair?  How comfortable is it?  How long have you been sitting here?
Think about the muscles in your bottom, pressed against that surface,
how uncomfortable they feel.  Focus on the aching feeling in your back
from sitting in this posture.  Keep your attention focused on your
bottom and your back, especially on the discomfort.  How is your
posture?  Think about what all that sitting is doing to your joints,
the discs in your back, especially those low down.  Now focus on your
breathing.  Is it starting to pick up?  How is your heart right now?
Can you feel it beating?  Is it fast or slow or arrhythmic?  <span
	class="keyword">Is it all right?</span>	Notice that where and how
you focus your attention directly affects how you feel, even if you
are doing nothing in particular.</p>

<p>Here’s another experiment:  Take a moment and think about what else
you could be doing <span class="keyword">right now,</span> or maybe
what you <span class="keyword">should be doing</span> right now.  Were
you planning to do something else before you started reading this?  Is
there something you need to get done today?  Why aren’t you doing it
now?  When are you going to get around to it?  What if it doesn’t get
done?  Are you forgetting something important?  Is someone counting on
you?  Continue your focus on these questions and then check your
anxiety level on the 1-10 scale above.  Notice how your attention to
your thoughts heightens the feelings that go along with them.. Anxious
people pay a lot of attention to disturbing thoughts, which makes
these thoughts more frightening.  Such thinking intimidates the person
who harbors them.  There are several approaches to counter such
intimidation:</p>

<p><strong>The Rational Approach.</strong>  Anxiety disorders tend to
produce fears that are not rational; i.e., they are not likely to
happen, and if they do, the experience isn’t likely to be as horrible
as imagined.  Take the <span class="keyword">social phobic</span> fear
of saying something wrong or saying something badly.  When you
actually do speak to someone is your speech really as bad as you
thought it would be?  And if you make a blooper – pause too long,
mispronounce someone‘s name – is it really the end of the world?  Or
take the <span class="keyword">obsessive-compulsive</span> fear of
accidentally leaving a light on when leaving the house, which could
somehow cause the house to burn down.  While not impossible, the odds
of an electric lamp burning down the house when no one’s home are low
to zero.  Or take the <span class="keyword">snake phobic</span> fear
of stepping on a snake in the woods.  Most snakes hear you coming and
are long gone before you cross their path, but even if you came across
one it would not likely harm you.  Or take the <span
	class="keyword">fear of panic</span> in which you believe you will
throw up in the middle of Wal-Mart if you don’t get out of the store
fast enough.  In fact if you just stay in the store and let the panic
attack run its course you are not likely to toss your cookies, but
even if you hurled all the way down Aisle 8 it wouldn’t be the end of
the world, and you might feel physical relief afterward.  Or take the
<span class="keyword">worrier’s</span> fear that her son will be in a
car wreck if he is late coming home.  Of all the possible reasons for
him to be late, an auto accident is one of the least likely.  Consider
more likely possibilities (e.g., forgot the time and hasn’t even left
yet, stopped somewhere on the way to see someone else, gave someone
else a ride home, etc.)</p>

<p>The Rational Approach asks you to examine your thoughts more
closely to determine their likelihood.  Research has shown that people
tend to overestimate risk when something primes them to think about
risk.  A common example is people who fear flying. Suppose you have
booked a flight for the day after tomorrow and in today’s paper you
read about an airplane going down somewhere, killing everybody on
board.  Although the crash may be all over the news, the odds of any
given flight getting into trouble the very next day are just as low as
they were the day before the crash.  We overestimate risk because the
news story primes us to think about the risk.</p>

<p>Sometimes our fears do come true.  People do sometimes become
tongue-tied when speaking in front of an audience, sometimes we say
the wrong things and people get mad at us, we forget something
important when we leave the house, we make mistakes at school or work,
the car runs out of gas because we forgot to fill up, the dog gets run
over, the list goes on and on.  When a feared event occurs, most of
the time the outcome is not as catastrophic as we imagined it to be.
The Rational Approach works to <span
	class="keyword">decatastrophize</span> such fears by walking
through each one of them and evaluating each step in terms of its
catastrophic value.  Take the social phobic who fears saying the wrong
thing at an important social gathering.  One way to test the notion
that such a blooper would be catastrophic is to make the blooper on
purpose and then observe the reactions of other people.  This little
experiment, called a <span class="keyword">shame attack</span>
exercise, allows the social phobic to see whether the dreaded outcome
really occurs.</p>

<p>The Rational Approach acknowledges that sometimes terrible events
do occur.  If you are on an airliner that is blown up the odds of
dying right then are excellent.  But the same could be said about
being struck by lightning.  Do you avoid going outside because of the
possibility you will be struck by lightning?  No, you go outside
because the odds of being struck by lightning are actually very very
low.  Comparing the odds of various lethal events can itself be
therapeutic, but it requires some familiarity with probabilities.  It
also helps you face the fact that you are mortal, which leads us to….
</p>

<p><strong>The Existential Approach.</strong>  This approach
acknowledges that we are mortal and will die of something or other at
some time or other.  Since we can’t know for sure when or how, the
existentialist suggests we focus on what we actually do while we’re
alive.  Taking action gives us purpose and also gets our minds off our
worries.  We can only accomplish what we do, not what we think about.
Or, as the philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said, “There is only one
day left, always starting over; it is given to us at dawn and taken
away from us at dusk.”</p>

<p><strong>The Faith Based Approach.</strong>  Faith in God is one of
the most powerful antidotes to anxiety.  Numerous studies have
demonstrated that believers are more likely to take risks than are
non-believers.  There are numerous scriptures from the Abrahamic
faiths (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) illustrating how faith in God
was sometimes the only thing that helped a person get through a crisis
without fear.  The 23 rd Psalm is a good example of facing fear
knowing God is with you.  Jesus’s comments in Luke’s Gospel (Chapter
22) put daily worries in the broader context of what is really
important.  Of course religion can sometimes produce its own brand of
anxiety, usually about right and wrong, whether you are a good person
or a bad person, doing God’s will or not, which brings on fears of
sinning or even going to hell.  Here the notion of forgiveness is
helpful.  Is God going to punish you for a particular thought?  If
not, why do you punish yourself?  Religious persons with OCD are often
beset with such obsessions, to the point where experiencing a “bad
thought” translates into being a “bad person.”  Unfortunately turning
to scripture does not always help this dilemma, and the Mindfulness
Approach may be more helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Mindfulness Strategies</strong> take a more Zen-like
approach to fear thoughts through a series of exercises designed to
put some distance between you and your thoughts.  Think of a bad
thought as a kind of mental hiccup.  You didn’t do anything to cause
it – it just happened.  The thought is not directly related to reality
or the outside world or even to your personhood.  It’s just a thought.
Like a hiccup, you can’t make it go away.  In fact, if you try to rid
your mind of it you only make it worse.  Mindfulness involves
observing the <span class="keyword">fearful thought,</span> as if it
you were watching it on a screen, more like an observer than a
participant.  There may be a stream of such thoughts, like a movie
with clips of this and that strung together randomly.  The point is,
you don’t have to do anything about them.  Even if they are
frightening or disgusting, just let them float on by – they are not a
part of you.  Let’s go back to that religious OCD person.  She is
sitting in church during the pastoral prayer and suddenly an obscene
word pops into her mind.  <span class="keyword">What if</span> she
were to blurt out that word!  That would be horrible!  As her fear
builds she feels an urge now to actually say it, maybe even shout the
word!  She tries to put her mind on something else but can’t focus –
the word is stuck in her mind.  What should she do, get up and leave?
No.  Stay seated, take a slow breath, and let the word pass.  Observe
the word, how many letters does it have, what does it look like
spelled backward.  Imagine the letters of the word on a Scrabble
board.  Mix them up, make a different word.  Or rapidly repeat the
word to yourself over and over until it no longer makes sense.  Like
an anxiety attack, the word will eventually lose its energy and fade.
Like a hiccup, it will disappear as quickly as it came.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance and Commitment therapy</strong> utilizes
mindfulness techniques but also like the Existentialists emphasizes
commitment to a goal or activity that not only gives your life meaning
but also keeps your mind from wandering to anxious thoughts.  This
notion is supported by research showing that people experience more
positive emotions when they are paying attention to what they are
doing (see the What’s New in Psychology article, <a 
	href="whats-new/dangers-of-the-wandering-mind">"The Dangers of the
	Wandering Mind"</a>).  For example, musicians sometimes speak of a
“groove” they get into when playing music that allows them to tune out
everything else and just “get into the music.”  Writers talk about a
“flow of words” when writing that allows them to do the same thing.
Artists, athletes, and even mathematicians sometimes experience the
same phenomenon, losing themselves in what they are doing.</p>

<p>Do you have to be good at something to experience flow?  Not at
all.  Some people can get into a flow just cleaning house or working
in the garden.  It discharges energy, gives you something specific to
focus on, and produces concrete results.  There may even be a driven
quality to it, but such activity is not a compulsion.  Activity driven
by a sense of purpose is different from activity driven by a sense of
dread in at least two ways:  First, while doing something purposeful
your mind is focused on the task.	You are literally living in the
moment.  In contrast, an anxious compulsion keeps you focused on how
the task will turn out (remember, anxiety always focuses on the
future), so you can’t really get into a groove or experience a sense
of flow.  Second, purposeful activity leads to a sense of
accomplishment.  Once you’re done, you can look back at it and feel
good about it.  In contrast, compulsions driven by anxiety often
result in a sense of failure – no matter how hard you worked at it, it
wasn’t good enough, you missed something, it could have been better.
In fact anxious compulsions feel like they’re never done.</p>

<h4>Behaviorist Approach (Face your fears)</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of anxiety is the <span
	class="keyword">avoidance</span> of activities it causes.
Behavioral strategies are designed to move anxious persons back into
activities they have been avoiding.  The most common strategy is the
Approach Hierarchy, which is described in more detail in the Therapy
Helper <a href="therapy-helpers/facing-fears">“Facing Fears”</a>.  This is basically a list of situations that
you have been avoiding, with the most frightening one at the top
(usually rated 100) and the easiest ones to face at the bottom (rated
somewhere between 1 and 10).  It helps to have a therapist create
these hierarchies so that they are behaviorally specified and arranged
in such a way that you can gain more confidence in yourself as you
move up the scale.  The following example describes a typical example
for agoraphobia, which is a fear of leaving the house.</p>

<h4>Example of Agoraphobia Hierarchy</h4>
<dl class="clearfix">
	<dt>100</dt>
	<dd>Driving alone to a distant city, spending the night, and returning
	alone.</dd>
	<dt>90</dt>
	<dd>Driving to a distant city, spending the night, and returning
	with a friend.</dd>
	<dt>80</dt>
	<dd>Driving alone to a city within 100 miles, spending the day
	shopping, and returning.</dd>
	<dt>75</dt>
	<dd>Driving alone to a city within 50 miles, getting gas, and
	returning.</dd>
	<dt>70</dt>
	<dd>Riding with a friend to a distant city, spending the night
	and returning.</dd>
	<dt>60</dt>
	<dd>Riding with a friend to a city within 100 miles, spending
	the day shopping and returning.</dd>
	<dt>55</dt>
	<dd>Driving alone to the grocery store when it’s busy, buying
	groceries, and returning home.</dd>
	<dt>50</dt>
	<dd>Driving yourself to church.</dd>
	<dt>45</dt>
	<dd>Driving alone to the grocery store when it’s not busy,
	buying groceries, and returning home.</dd>
	<dt>40</dt>
	<dd>Walking downtown alone, entering a couple stores, and
	returning home.</dd>
	<dt>35</dt>
	<dd>Going for a drive alone for an hour.</dd>
	<dt>33</dt>
	<dd>Going for a ride with a friend for a couple hours.</dd>
	<dt>30</dt>
	<dd>Driving to a restaurant and meeting a friend for lunch.</dd>
	<dt>20</dt>
	<dd>Walking downtown with a friend and going shopping.</dd>
	<dt>17</dt>
	<dd>Making a phone call.</dd>
	<dt>15</dt>
	<dd>Answering the telephone.</dd>
	<dt>12</dt>
	<dd>Stepping outside to say Hi to your neighbor.</dd>
	<dt>10</dt>
	<dd>Walking around the block.</dd>
	<dt>5</dt>
	<dd>Going outside to the mailbox.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Hierarchies are best created by designating your worst fear at the
top, the least anxious situation at the bottom, and a midway activity
(rated 50) that divides the hierarchy into top and bottom halves.
Note that these hierarchies are very personalized and must be tailored
to your individual needs.  For example, in the example above driving
to church (rated 50) is considered more anxiety provoking than going
for a drive alone for an hour.  Note also that slightly altering the
situation may make it more anxiety provoking.  Some agoraphobics are
also socially phobic and restrict their shopping to times of the day
when there are few other shoppers in the store.  Thus in the example
above going to the grocery store when it’s not busy is rated lower
(45) than when it is busy (55).  Such attempts to make yourself feel
safe when going out are called <span class="keyword">safety 
	behaviors.</span></p>

<p>Safety behaviors are somewhat like crutches in that they help you
face frightening situations, but unlike crutches you never get rid of
them because they actually keep your fear of these situations alive.
Although they provide a sense of overcoming fear, you come to depend
upon them to feel safe when facing these situations.  Without them you
will feel even more anxious.  Examples include</p>

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Going out only at certain times of the day</li>
	<li>Going to a party only if certain people are going to be
	there</li>
	<li>Always carrying a cell phone “in case of emergency”</li>
	<li>Wearing a special garment when you go out, regardless of the
	weather</li>
	<li>Carrying a lucky charm</li>
	<li>Keeping a dose of anti-anxiety medicine on your person at all
	times</li>
	<li>Taking a specific route to a destination even if it’s not
	direct or efficient</li>
	<li>Waiting at least six rings before answering the phone</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples like these usually come into play through <span
	class="keyword">negative reinforcement.</span>  That is, the first
time you engage in them in an anxious situation you feel more at ease,
so you are more likely to do the same thing the next time you’re in
the same situation.  Feeling at ease reinforces the safety behavior in
the same way that the famous psychologist B. F.  Skinner trained
pigeons to develop little rituals when pressing a key for food.	He
noted the similarity between these little rituals the superstitious
behaviors of people.</p>

<p>In contrast to <span class="keyword">safety behaviors, approach
	behaviors</span> more directly expose one to the fearful situation.
Examples of approach behaviors are as follows:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Leave the house at all times of the day</li>
	<li>Go to the party without your friends</li>
	<li>Leave the house without your cell phone, medicine, lucky charm,
	special coat, etc.</li>
	<li>Take a different route to your destination every time you go
	out</li>
	<li>Answer the phone on the first ring</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting rid of <span class="keyword">safety behaviors</span> is
difficult because when you try to stop doing them your anxiety
initially gets worse!  Talking yourself through them with directives
like, “Just do it!” and “I can do this!” sometimes helps.  Breaking
these habits may require someone to walk you through the <span
	class="keyword">approach behavior</span> so that you actually do
it.  But watch out!  Sticking too close to your helper could become
your next safety behavior.</p>

<p>A behaviorist approach to reducing fear of <span
	class="keyword">physical arousal</span> involves exposing yourself to
bodily cues that promote the anxiety.  This technique is called <span
	class="keyword">interoceptive exposure</span>.  Common internal
sensations during panic include rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing or
swallowing, hyperventilation and light-headedness or a sense of
unreality, caused by an increase in carbon dioxide.  Some people are very
sensitive to internal sensations, from their lungs to their muscles,
heart rate, bowels or bladder.  They are on “high alert” for any slight
alteration in the functioning of these organs, and they become anxious
when something “feels wrong,” which leads to the fear of losing control.
This fear focuses attention on these sensations, which escalate and
become more worrisome.  One way to reduce this fear is to <span
	class="keyword">make the sensation happen on purpose</span>, or expose
yourself to it as an exercise.  For example, practice breathing rapidly
for 60 seconds to bring on the internal sensation of hyperventilation.
When you stop, see how long it takes for the woozy feeling to subside.
Time yourself if you like.  Instead of fighting the feeling, go with it.
Let it roll over you.  Let your breathing slow back down by itself.
Don’t try to make it happen, just let it follow its own course.	Here’s
another exercise: Run in place until you get your heart rate up to 150
beats per minute.  Don’t stop just because you feel faint or dizzy.
After about a minute, stop or walk slowly around the room.  Continue
walking or just breathing normally until your heart rate subsides.  There
are many different interoceptive exposure exercises.  (See Chapter 10 of
the book, <cite><a
	href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Panic-Breakthrough-Techniques-Overcoming/dp/1572241136">An
	End to Panic</a></cite> published by New Harbinger Press.)  The key is to
practice them once or twice a day until the sensations they create no
longer frighten you.  Practice experiencing the sensations not only gives
you more confidence in dealing with them but also desensitizes you to
them when they occur spontaneously.</p>

<p>Behavioral practice helps you face other stresses besides internal
sensations.  Even the most experienced actors and public speakers
rehearse what they are going to say before they perform in public.
Rehearsal helps you get comfortable with your own words and gives you
an opportunity to try out different approaches.  Rehearsal also helps
you get comfortable with making mistakes.  Practice your flub-ups at
home.  However, it’s important to remember that rehearsal doe not
eliminate mistakes.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Rehearsal desensitizes
you to making mistakes.  Thus rehearsal is a prelude to exposure, not
an avoidance strategy.</p>

<h3>Ready for Treatment?</h3>
<p>Now that you have read over the types of Anxiety Disorders, make
some notes about your own symptoms, noting</p>

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Your physical symptoms</li>
	<li>Your thoughts</li>
	<li>Situations you are avoiding</li>
	<li>Behaviors that get in the way of facing your fears</li>
</ul>

<p>Review the treatment approaches listed above and decide which
ones you would like to try.  Therapy for anxiety disorders works
best with a therapist to help you identify your target symptoms and
coordinate your treatment strategies.</p>
