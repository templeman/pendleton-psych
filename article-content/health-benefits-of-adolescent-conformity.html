<p>Conformity is not something most Americans cherish. We like our sons and
  daughters to grow up thinking for themselves.  Yet during adolescence it is
  quite common for youth to band together into groups that strongly influence
  how they dress, talk, and think.  Parental exhortations to “Think for
  yourself” and “Stop following the crowd” often lead to rebuttals such as, “I
  have to be there for my friends; they’re counting on me!”</p>

<p>As much as parents would like their teens to think and act independently, a
  recent study by psychologists at the University of Virginia and University of
  Utah suggests that “following the crowd” may actually have mental and
  physical health benefits for teens in the long run.  The researchers
  interviewed 171 teens and their friends periodically over a period of 14
  years (from the ages of 13 to 27 years old) to measure allegiance to their
  group and also to their closest friends over time.  They also surveyed the
  participants periodically about their physical and mental health.  By age 27
  those who had conformed the most to the wishes and expectations of their
  group (as rated by their friends) reported better physical and mental health
  as young adults than those who were considered more nonconformists.</p>

<p>These results may seem surprising but are consistent with other findings
  that “going it alone” is not healthy for teens.  Socially isolated teens are
  more likely to have health problems as adults.</p>

<p>So how does being a follower, letting others take the lead, and putting the
  needs of the group over individual needs make one healthier?  The authors
  noted that the physical health benefits were correlated with the mental
  health benefits of group affiliation.  Belonging to a group confers a sense
  of identity which can lift self-esteem, and also security. You don’t have to
  rely solely on your own personality or skills to feel good about yourself,
  and you don’t have to face the world alone.  Being part of a group also
  provides its members opportunities to practice social skills.</p>

<p>So maybe encouraging your teen to resist peer pressure isn’t always such a
  good idea, especially if it isolates your son or daughter from a potential
  source of social support.  Of course groups can acquire bad habits, just as
  individuals can.  So what’s a parent to do?  One obvious strategy is to
  become acquainted with your teen’s group of friends, even the sketchy ones.
  Get to know their parents and form your own social support network.  By
  encouraging social connections and familiarizing yourself with your teen’s
  support system, you will know more about what they’re up to, and you may even
  have some influence over them.  In the long run you and your teen may be
  healthier for it.</p>
