<h4>The Importance of Staying Calm</h4>
<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Anxious/angry parents model anxiousness and inappropriate anger
	for the child</li>
	<li>Anxious parents are less likely to follow through on
	consequences</li>
	<li>Angry parent/child interactions reinforce acting out behavior by
	the child (<a href="parent-child-coercive-cycle">The Coercive
		Parent/Child Cycle</a>)</li>
	<li>Angry/anxious parents are easily distracted when trying to
	discipline</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Stay Calm During Discipline</h4>
<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Rehearse what you intend to say ahead of time.</li>
	<li>Take a deep breath before your encounter.</li>
	<li>Keep your voice low and measured when talking.</li>
	<li>Take your time in responding to your child’s comments.</li>
	<li>Stay focused on the behavior goal (e.g., Homework first, Xbox
	later).</li>
	<li>Anticipate the child’s reaction to your behavior (e.g., He’s going
	to blow up when he can’t find his Xbox).</li>
	<li>Talk yourself through it (“I can get through this. If I stay calm
	she’ll calm down.)</li>
	<li>Call in another adult to help.</li>
	<li>Have an Exit Strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools that Decrease Fear</h4>

	<li>Identifying your “What if” thoughts</li>
	<li>Realistically appraising risk</li>
	<li>Decatastrophizing</li>
</ul>
