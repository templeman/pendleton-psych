<p>Last year I posted an article on the videogame habits of 8 to 18 year
olds (See <a href="videogame-addiction">“Can Kids Become Addicted to
	Videogames?”</a>). Now comes a longitudinal study from psychologists at
Denison University in Ohio on the effects of videogame usage on academic
performance. What makes this study unique is that it selected boys who
had little prior experience with videogames and measured their school
performance and behavior for four months after giving some of them Play
Station 2’s to keep at their homes. Sixty-four boys ages 6 to 9 years old
participated with the permission of their parents. The parents were told
that the study was about academic and behavioral development and that all
the families would receive a PS 2 for their participation. This way none
of the families actually knew the study was about videogames. All the
boys were administered tests of reading, spelling and math, and their
parents and teachers completed questionnaires about their behavior. Half
of the boys were then given the PS 2’s and asked to keep diaries of their
daily after school activities for four months. The other half were
promised the PS 2’s at the end of the experiment (four months later).
After four months all the boys were tested again, and parents and
teachers filled out the same questionnaires.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>First, all of the boys in the two groups showed similar abilities in
reading, writing, and math before the PS 2’s were introduced.</p>

<p>Second, 90 % of the boys who got the PS 2’s purchased more videogames
during the four months and averaged about 40 minutes a day playing them.
Interestingly, even the boys who didn’t get the PS 2’s spent some time
playing videogames during the study (about 9 minutes per day average),
indicating that they had access to games elsewhere.</p> 

<p>Third, the boys with PS 2’s spent only about 18 minutes per day on
homework while the boys without videogames spent nearly 32 minutes per
day on homework.</p>

<p>Fourth, Boys without the PS 2’s showed increases in their reading and
writing scores over the four months, whereas the boys playing the
videogames showed no increases in either reading or writing skills. Plus
their teachers rated the gamer boys as falling behind in reading and
writing by the end of the study. There were no differences in math
abilities at the end of the study.</p>

<p>Finally, there were no differences in behavior between the two groups
at the end of the study as reported by either the parents or the
teachers.</p>

<p>The implications of the study are clear. Time spent on videogames
instead of homework after school will lower academic performance, at
least for reading and spelling. So why not math? The authors cite other
research indicating that time spent on homework benefits language skills
more than numerical skills. Math homework requires a lot of sustained
concentration, that is, time when the student just has to sit and think.
For that reason many students may put off their math homework and instead
do the spelling lists or reading assignments. Thus videogames may not
affect math learning as much because the kids aren’t devoting that much
time to math anyway. Whatever the reason, the study demonstrates that
videogame availability takes away from time that would otherwise be spent
doing homework, which in turn prevents children from making academic
gains in school.</p>
