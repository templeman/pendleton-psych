<p>One of the greatest achievements in twentieth century psychology was
the explanation of reinforcement and how it influences behavior. Early
work by Pavlov, Thorndike, and Watson demonstrated how behavior
patterns are formed by pairing two different stimuli together (e.g.,
electric shock and a flash of light, or a piece of food and the ringing
of a bell) to produce the same behavioral reaction (escape in the first
example and approach in the second), but it was B. F. Skinner who first
demonstrated instrumental reinforcement and the many ways it works in
everyday life, not just in animals but in human beings as well.</p>

<h4>What Is It?</h4>
<p>Reinforcement is not so much a thing as it is relationship between a
behavior and an event that follows it. Behaviors often increase when
closely followed by certain events. Example: A dog looks up at its master
during supper and gets a scrap of meat from the table --Voila! instead of
going away the dog looks up again, maybe with more eagerness this time.
Everyone has seen this kind of behavior in animals, children, and even
adults, but Professor Skinner was able to measure precisely the strength
of the effect across a variety of schedules of reinforcement.</p>

<h4>Terms</h4>
<p><strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> is any consequence to an
action that increases the likelihood that action will happen again. Such
events are called Positive Reinforcers. Notice that this definition
allows for individual variation, so that what reinforces one person on
one occasion may not reinforce another or even the same person on another
occasion. However, there are many reinforcers that work for most human
beings. For example, if you make eye contact with a person who smiles at
you in the course of a conversation, you will make more eye contact with
that person during your conversation. Smiling and making eye contact are
simple but powerful reinforcers of social behavior. If you give a child a
piece of candy each time he says “please” or “thank you” she will be more
likely to use those words again in the same context. But reinforcers
don’t have to be things. If you tell an employee “Good job!” each time he
gets a task done on time he will be more likely to work harder at the
next task. Positive reinforcement is strongest when it occurs just after
the behavior you want to increase. It weakens the longer you wait to use
it.</p>

<p><strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> occurs when an aversive
experience suddenly stops. It occurs most commonly in social
interactions. Example: You are in a heated argument with someone who is
getting louder and more aggressive. You feel faint, the blood drains from
your face, and you collapse into a chair. The other person suddenly stops
arguing, changes tone and asks in a worried voice if you are OK.	Your
“fainting spell” has just been negatively reinforced, and the next time
you argue with this person you will be more likely to have the same
reaction. It is the removal of the other person’s angry tone that is
reinforcing. Notice that neither person’s action is deliberate or even
something they are aware of. Yet it is the first building block of a
habitual way of ending arguments for these two people. Here is a less
dramatic example: You are in a conversation with someone at a party who
is boring you to tears. Your eyes glaze over and you yawn. The other
person stops talking and moves on, which reinforces your glazed eyes and
yawning, which are more likely to occur again in a similar context. Here
again neither person may be aware of how the removal of one behavior
affects the behavior that just preceded it.</p>

<p>Lots of our daily habits, especially those that momentarily relieve
stress or discomfort, operate within the framework of negative
reinforcement. In a study years ago at the University of Oregon people
were observed at a particularly long traffic light to see what they would
do with their hands during the two minutes they had to wait to go.
Smokers often lit up at this intersection, whereas other people would
pick their noses or bite their fingernails. (Today they would probably
flick open their cell phones.) Why? Probably because each of these simple
actions provided just enough “relief” from the discomfort to be
reinforcing and thus became habits.</p>

<p><strong>Punishment</strong> is an aversive event that suppresses
ongoing behavior and causes avoidance or even escape. Going back to the
dog looking up at its master at the dinner table, if instead of giving it
a scrap of meat from the table it got a slap on the nose the dog would
likely withdraw with a slight yelp. Its looking up for food would be
suppressed, at least momentarily. If it got a slap every time it tried to
look up, the act of coming up to the table would eventually be
suppressed. If its master came after it with a stick it would try to
escape. Notice that punishment does not reinforce anything or teach any
new behaviors. It merely causes the animal to stop whatever it’s doing
and try to get away.. It works the same way for people. Example: A work
crew is standing around visiting before starting a job. Suddenly the boss
jumps out of the pickup hopping mad and starts yelling at them to get
busy or else! The talk immediately stops and the workers take off in all
directions. Punishment is a common strategy for parents who want their
children to stop what they are doing (e.g. making too much noise) or
clear out and leave the parent in peace. For humans even the threat of
punishment is enough to suppress behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Extinction</strong> is the removal of reinforcement, which is
ultimately followed by a lessening of the behavior that was previously
reinforced. Going back to the dog at the table example, if the dog’s
entreaty was completely ignored by its master, the approach and looking
up would eventually fade away. However, even a look from the master can
be just reinforcing enough for the dog to keeping looking up, so
extinction of a response is not always as easy as you might think. For
extinction to work the reinforcement must be withdrawn completely and
consistently. Ignoring the dog most of the time but giving in to it once
in a while actually makes things worse through an operation called
intermittent reinforcement.</p>

<p><strong>Intermittent reinforcement</strong> is the off-and-on use of
reinforcement, and it is very effective in locking in behaviors that
precede it. For example, the first time you tell your employee “Good
job!” for completing a task in a timely manner it will have more effect
than after the fourth or fifth time in a row that you say it. After a
while the employee comes to expect it, and it loses some of its
reinforcing value. By fading the “Good job!” comment to once in a while
the desired behavior will actually occur more consistently. Dr. Skinner
actually mapped out schedules of reinforcement in thousands of studies
showing how the strength of reinforcement changed as a function of how
often the reinforcer occurred.  Intermittent reinforcement cans also work
against you when you are trying to modify a behavior. Going back to the
person at the party, if you slip and make eye contact or otherwise show
interest when you would actually like the other person to stop talking,
you are accidentally reinforcing the behavior you want to stop. Even
occasional “slip-ups” in showing attention become a kind of intermittent
reinforcement.</p>
