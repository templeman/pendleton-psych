<p>What do marching bands, religious chanting, reciting the pledge of
allegiance, singing in unison, and rock concert mosh pits have in common?
A recent study from Stanford suggests such synchronizing activities
facilitate bonding and mutual support among the participants.</p>

<p>The researchers actually conducted three studies. First, a guide led
groups of three people on tours of campus. Some of the groups were asked
to walk in step with each other as they went along. Later all the groups
participated in a number guessing game which involved second guessing the
numbers picked by the other members of the group so that the group’s
payoff (in cash) would be high. Group members were also asked questions
about their connectedness to their group and how much they trusted other
members in their group. Those groups who had walked in step on their
tours were better at clustering their numbers and earning higher pay-offs
on the number guessing game than groups who had not walked in step. They
also reported greater feelings of connectedness and trust with their
group than did the other groups.</p>

<p>The second study involved groups of three listening to the Canadian
National Anthem (none of the subjects were Canadian) on headphones and
holding plastic cups. Those who were instructed to sing along with the
chorus while moving their plastic cups back and forth in time to the
music later scored higher on the number guessing game and reported higher
levels of trust and connectedness than those who merely listened to the
music and held their cups. <em>They also scored higher than groups who sang
and moved their cups out of sync with the rest of their group.</em></p> 

<p>The last study repeated the music and cups exercise and then asked
groups to play a game in which they could earn money and contribute it to a
common fund for the group or keep the cash for themselves. The groups that
sang and moved their cups in unison later contributed more to the group
fund and kept less cash for themselves than did the non- sync groups.</p>

<p>So what do these simple experiments with college students tell us
about the human condition? First, they add to a growing body of research
revealing how much human beings are tuned in to the actions of others
around them. Second, they offer insight into why people engage in
synchronous activity, whether it be dancing and singing or marching. By
the way, the synchronized groups did not report feeling any happier than
the other groups after the experiments. Singing together or moving in
step is not simply a feel-good exercise. Soldiers marching into battle
are not doing so out of sheer joy; nor are Christians when they say the
Lord’s Prayer in unison. Such synchronous activity is more likely
creating a bond among the participants that facilitates cooperation and
even sacrifice. When acting in unison we are thinking collectively and
not individually. This sense of unity may explain why some groups of
people reunite from time to time even after long separations. It may also
help explain why those of us in step with our peers are wary of people
who seem “out of step” or who “march to the beat of a different drummer.”
But that is conjecture for further research.</p>
