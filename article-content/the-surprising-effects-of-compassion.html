<p>The Dalai Lama once commented that psychologists spend too much time
studying misbehavior and not enough time studying good behavior.  In a
recent experiment on compassion Pendleton native son Paul Condon and
colleague David DeSteno of Northeastern University have gone some
distance in following the Dalai Lama’s suggestion, with surprising
results.</p>

<p>Forty-four college students participated in the research, which was 
advertised as a study of mathematical ability and perception. The 
participants were paid for each of 20 math problems solved within a 
certain amount of time. Each actual subject was seated between a male 
and female “student” who were really accomplices of the experimenters. 
All three solved problems on a computer screen in the same room, then 
an experimenter entered and was supposed to check each person’s work, 
shred their sheets of problems, and pay them cash. However, after 
checking and paying the female “student” and the real participant, the 
experimenter said he was out of cash and left the room to get some 
more money before checking the third “student’s” work. While the 
experimenter was out of the room the “student” shredded his paper in 
front of the other two students. When the experimenter returned the 
“student” told him that he got all 20 problems correct and had already 
shredded his work. The experimenter, after some hesitation, paid the 
“student” the full amount for his work, and the entire exchange was 
witnessed by the real participant and the female “student.”</p>

<p>The next part of the study involved a visual discrimination test, 
also administered on the computer, which actually served no purpose 
other than to convince the real participants that the experiment was 
about perception. However, once it was over half of the participants 
witnessed the female “student” become emotional, start crying (with 
help from eye drops she had slipped into her eyes), and telling the 
experimenter that she had just learned recently that her brother had 
cancer and that it was really bothering her “right now.” The 
experimenter then allowed the female “student” to leave without 
finishing the experiment. The other half of the participants witnessed 
the female “student” merely saying she was late for a doctor’s 
appointment and then being allowed to leave.</p>

<p>The final phase of the experiment involved participants mixing 
various sauces for a “taste discrimination” test they would administer 
to each other. The condiments included jars of “hot sauce” as well as 
less spicy items such as chocolate and jam. The participants were also 
allowed to view a questionnaire supposedly completed by the male 
“student” indicating a strong dislike for spicy food. The amount of 
hot sauce the participants put in the “taste test” for the male 
student was measured and recorded.</p>

<p>Finally, all participants completed a questionnaire about their 
emotional state during the experiment, which included a measure of 
compassion, before leaving the study.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>As you might expect, and consistent with other research showing 
that people generally dislike cheaters, most participants added a lot 
of hot sauce to the “taste test” for the male “student” who appeared 
to be cheating on his math problems – that is, unless they also 
witnessed the other “student” crying. Participants who had observed 
the “crying student” did not add more hot sauce. They also reported 
feelings of compassion on their follow-up questionnaires that the 
other participants did not report.</p>

<p>What would you conclude from this study? Condon and DeSteno suggest 
that feeling compassion for one person “radiates” even to persons 
whose actions we would otherwise want to punish. Compassion thus is a 
surprisingly powerful emotion. One wonders how long such radiation 
lasts. We know from other recent research (see other What’s New 
articles) that people are subtly affected emotionally and behaviorally 
by all sorts of prompts around them, from cluttered subways to fast 
food signs, but how long do these effects last?	In this experiment the 
compassion felt for a grieving student lasted long enough for the 
participants to keep from punishing the “cheater” student as severely 
as they otherwise would. I wonder what the Dalai Lama would say about 
that.</p>
