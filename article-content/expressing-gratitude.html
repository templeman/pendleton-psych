<p>Everyone knows how good it feels to be appreciated by someone else,
but how does expressing gratitude affect the one who expresses it?
Researchers at Yale, Florida State University, and the New College of
Florida recently set out to answer that question.</p>

<p>In their first experiment they asked 137 college students to complete
a survey about two issues: 1) how often they express gratitude to their
partner or significant other in their daily lives, and 2) how strong
their relationship is with that other person, which they call “communal
strength.” They found that expressing gratitude and communal strength are
highly correlated.</p>

<p>In their second experiment they asked another 218 students to complete
the same survey about expressing gratitude and relationship strength at
two different times, 6 weeks apart. They found that the tendency to
express gratitude at Time 1 was correlated with perceived strength of
relationship at Time 2, regardless of how strong the tendency was at Time
1.</p>

<p>In their final experiment they randomly assigned 75 students to one of
four conditions. Students were instructed to either 1) increase their
expressions of gratitude (verbally or through writing) to their partner
twice a week for a 3 week period; 2) pay attention to activities with
their partner and write them down twice a week; 3) think of positive past
events in the relationship and bring them up with their partner twice a
week; or 4) pay attention to events that made them feel gratitude toward
their partner and write them down twice a week but not express them to
their partner. There was no initial difference in communal strength
scores among the four groups, so they all started out at the same level
of relationship, but after three weeks the students who had been
instructed to express gratitude to their partners reported higher
communal strength scores in their relationships than did any of the other
groups.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the subjects in this study were all college students
in a time of life when people are typically focused on starting
relationships, the results may nevertheless have implications for the
rest of us, mainly that expressing gratitude to our partners makes us
feel stronger and probably more committed to them than just trying to be
pleasant around them or merely feeling grateful toward them. The authors
suggest that actually coming out and expressing gratitude may have two
benefits. First, it positively affects how we see ourselves (i.e., “I’m
being good and doing something nice for my partner”). Second, it likely
produces good feelings in our partners as well, which they will probably
give back to us, thus strengthening the relationship.</p>

<p>Of course, to really test this idea, we should probably try it out
ourselves. Expressing gratitude to others might even improve other
relationships in our daily lives.</p>
