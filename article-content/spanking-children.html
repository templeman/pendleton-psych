<p>Debates about spanking have been around a long time, with most psychologists
  advising against it.  Nevertheless over 80% of parents continue to use
  physical punishment as a means of discipline.  Some researchers have also
  challenged the evidence against spanking, contending that not all forms of
  physical punishment are harmful and that context and parenting style must be
  taken into consideration when evaluating its harmfulness.  Some also contend
  that its effectiveness in improving a child’s behavior outweighs the
  immediate harm of physical punishment.</p>

<p>Recently a group of psychologists from several universities around the
  country reviewed the extensive research literature on physical punishment,
  taking into consideration other factors besides physical punishment that
  might affect the results, such as experimental designs, context, parenting
  styles, and even culture. One big problem in trying to study the harmful
  effects of physical punishment is how to set up the experiment.   Studies
  that merely demonstrate that kids who are spanked at home later display more
  behavior problems, mental health problems, poorer performance in school, and
  poorer relationships with their parents provide some information about the
  effects of physical punishment, but they don’t prove that the spanking caused
  the problems.  Other factors besides spanking may have caused some of these
  later behaviors.  To rule out other factors would require a study in which
  some parents were randomly assigned to spank their children and other parents
  assigned to only use nonphysical consequences for bad behavior.  Such a study
  is impractical and probably unethical, so researchers have had to turn to
  other experimental methods.</p>

<p>One set of studies looks at children’s behavior at a young age, identifies
  which parents use physical punishment and which don’t, and follows the two
  groups of children over time as they grow older.  These studies have included
  over 11,000 children and demonstrated that spanking as early as age 1 and
  repeated over intervals to age 16 predicted later behavior problems for these
  children.  None of the studies found evidence that spanking decreased
  behavior problems as the children aged.  Furthermore, children who were more
  frequently spanked showed higher levels of behavior problems as they grew
  older.</p>

<p>Another set of experiments used random assignment in a creative manner:
  instead of randomly assigning parents to spank or not spank, they randomly
  assigned some of the parents who spank to programs that teach them how to use
  other discipline methods that avoid physical punishment.   Children of the
  parents who learned nonphysical methods of discipline showed a decrease in
  behavior problems in school compared to those children whose parents
  continued to use physical punishment.</p>

<p>The reviewers also looked at research into levels of physical punishment to
  examine whether low levels of physical punishment might not be harmful.
  These studies compared children who were physically abused with those <em>in
    the same households</em> who were merely spanked.  Both sets of children
  demonstrated behavior problems at school, but the abused children
  demonstrated more serious problems.  These results indicate that all physical
  punishment is harmful, and that the harsher the physical discipline, the more
  likely that child will have serious problems later.</p>

<p>A number of studies have looked at the role of culture in physical
  punishment.  Surveys indicate that African American parents endorse and
  practice physical punishment more often than do European Americans or Latino
  Americans.  However, even within the African American population, children of
  parents who use physical punishment are more likely to display behavior
  problems than children of parents who don’t.</p>

<p>Parenting style has also been studied as a factor that may account for the
  harmful effects of physical punishment.  Perhaps it’s not the spanking itself
  but the harsh, punitive attitude of the parent that actually creates the
  child’s problem behaviors.  Supporting this idea, some studies have found
  that the negative effects of spanking are more harmful when parents score low
  in warmth and high in negativity.  However studies following parents and
  children over several decades did not find that parental warmth diminished
  the negative effects of spanking on the children’s behavior.</p>

<p>The bottom line from all this research is straightforward: Spanking and
  similar forms of physical punishment are not healthy for children, especially
  if it starts when the child is very young.  Children who are regularly
  spanked as punishment are more likely to act out in school, aggress toward
  other children, experience later mental health problems, and develop more
  conflicted relationships with their parents than children who are not
  physically punished.  Spanking is likely to be even more harmful to the child
  when administered by an angry parent.  Thus the lesson for parents of kids of
  all ages is to stay calm during discipline and have nonphysical consequences
  ready when your child misbehaves.</p>
