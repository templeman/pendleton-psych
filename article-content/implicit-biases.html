  Centuries after Aristotle said, “Know thyself,” most of us still have a lot
  to learn about ourselves. Thanks to Sigmund Freud, we realize that at least
  some of our actions are driven by unconscious motives. Thanks to B.F.
  Skinner we also know how easy it is to be conditioned to act in certain ways
  without our awareness. But when it comes to our personal beliefs about
  ourselves, we ought to know what we’re talking about, right? Well, maybe
  not.
</p>

<p>A growing body of research using a new tool called the Implicit Association
  Test, created by Tony Greenwald at the University of Washington and
  developed further by Greenwald and Harvard professor Mahzarin Banaji,
  demonstrates how our unconscious biases conflict with our professed beliefs.
  Here’s how it works. You pick a topic about which you have an opinion,
  let’s say growing older. Words or photos that reference that topic (e.g.,
  “elderly,” or “young” ) are flashed on a computer screen and paired either
  with positive attributes (e.g., “wise,” “kindly”) or negative attributes
  (“slow,” “mean”). The pairs are presented to the right and left sides of
  the screen. Your task is to hit a key on the key board either to the right
  or left, depending on the instructions. Sometimes you are asked to respond
  to positive attributes paired with “older” and negative with “younger,” and
  sometimes to the opposite pairings. The computer merely measures your
  reaction time to the various paired items, then averages your responses over
  many trials, during which the words or pictures switch sides of the screen.
  Once you are done the program reports your tendency to associate certain
  positive or negative attributes to the topic studied. Anybody can take the
  test, on any number of topics, and it’s free! Just go to

<p>Drs. Greenwood and Banaji have now published the results of their research
  in a new book called <em>Blind Spot: The Hidden Biases of Good People,</em>
  published by Delacorte Press. The early research studied racial biases and
  showed that even liberal minded persons associate non-European races with
  negative traits, as measured by their reaction times to these pairings.
  More recently topics include gender roles, weight gain, aging, mental
  illness, and nationality. In each case what we say we believe does not
  always correspond to how quickly we respond to certain stereotypes.
  Greenwald and Banaji suggest that our minds learn to categorize other people
  early in life as either the “in-group” or the “out-group.” We attribute
  positive qualities to the in-group and negative qualities to the out-group.
  We tend to favor the in-group and distance ourselves from the out-group.
  Sometimes the in-group stereotype represents people like us, but not always.
  For example, even elderly people show a positive bias toward younger people
  compared to older people on the IAT. Furthermore our hidden biases are
  often better predictors of our behavior in real-life situations than our
  conscious beliefs. For example, a strong <em>men=science</em> bias in women as
  measured by the IAT is a better predictor of women’s choice of college
  majors than is their conscious endorsement of the <em>men=science</em> stereotype.
</p>

<p>Beyond stereotype biases, research presented at the recent meeting of the
  Association for Psychological Science (APS, San Francisco, May, 2014) also
  demonstrates the usefulness of the IAT for studying clinical populations.
  For example, biased reaction times to self/suicide pairings better predicted
  future suicide attempts by depressed persons than did their conscious
  estimates of future risk. Pairing specific objects and anxious cues (such
  as internal states) better predicts phobic reactions to those objects than
  does responses to questionnaires.
</p>

<p>Ultimately the IAT may provide us insight into what it means to be human.
  At the recent APS meeting Dr. Banaji suggested that human beings learn early
  what group they belong to and who they should associate with. These
  implicit associations are part of the glue that binds families, tribes,
  religious sects, regional affiliations, races, and national allegiances.
  The merging of various groups in America over the past several hundred years
  has become a natural experiment to see how well various groups can expand to
  incorporate others not quite like ourselves. The world itself is following
  suit and changing from a collection of tightly bound homogeneous groups to
  broadly defined heterogeneous populations governed by laws rather than
  natural affinity. These laws of incorporation are the product of the
  conscious and rational networks of our brains, what Daniel Kahnemann calls
  Type 2 systems, and not the implicit associations that occur unconsciously.
  As Dr. Banaji suggested in her presentation, the challenge for groups who
  want to live with each other peacefully is to decouple some of these
  stubborn implicit biases that set them against each other.

<p>
  Take the IAT and check out some of your own unconscious biases. You just might get to Know Yourself a little better!
