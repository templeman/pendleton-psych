<p>Edgar Allan Poe once wrote a short story called <a
	href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Imp_of_the_Perverse">“The Imp
	of the Perverse,”</a> about a man who gets away with murder only to
blurt out his secret later in the presence of a police officer. His
confession is not merely a slip of the tongue. The murderer has no wish
to confess – “Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it” –
but he literally can’t stop himself: “The long-imprisoned secret burst
forth from my soul.” Poe declared that such an impish impulse sometimes
causes all of us to “act, for the reason that we should
<em>not</em>.”</p>

<p>Now David Wegner, a Harvard psychologist, has proposed a mechanism for
how this imp works. In an article titled, “How to think, say, or do
precisely the worst thing for any occasion.” Wegner describes an “ironic
process” that operates when we try to suppress a thought. He and
colleagues have studied how people respond to instructions to <em>not
	think about a specific thing</em> (e.g., “Do not think about a white
bear”). As people try to suppress such a thought it pops back into
consciousness at the rate of about once a minute and keeps popping up
occasionally for days. When subjects are asked about how they respond to
this instruction, they typically report trying to <em>put their minds on
	something else.</em> This strategy sort of works because the mind can’t
hold two thoughts in consciousness at the same time. Wegner points out
however that in order to keep a particular thought out of mind there has
to be a mechanism to detect that very thought so as to screen it. He
defines this ironic process “an unconscious search for the very mental
state that is unwanted.”</p>

<p>So in order to not think about a white bear there are two mental
processes going on at the same time:</p> 

<ol>
	<li>a conscious search for distracters, and</li>
	<li>an unconscious search for “white bear.”</li>
</ol>

<p>It turns out that trying to control conscious thoughts and unconscious
impulses at the same time takes a lot of mental effort, which makes the
control system prone to errors. The “imp” arises when the control system
becomes stressed, overloaded, or distracted. At such times conscious
control loosens and the unconscious thought or impulse pops out.</p>

<p>Wegner has studied how such impish thoughts or images leak out. For
example, in laboratory experiments people instructed not to think about
sex show greater arousal to sexual images than people who are given no
instructions. In another experiment, people rated past romances that were
secret as more arousing than those romances which were not secret. In
another lab experiment, persons instructed to keep one item out of four
on a table hidden from a partner were more likely to let it show than
those not so instructed. Research with people who have eating disorders
found that those who were trying not to disclose their eating disorder
during an interview later reported more intrusive thoughts about eating
than persons who were not trying to hide their eating disorder. These
ironic processes are also influenced by our social biases. British
subjects instructed to suppress their feelings about white supremacists
actually moved their chairs farther away from “skinheads” in the groups
they attended than those not given any instructions.</p>

<p>Athletic performance is also affected by these processes. Studies of
golfers have shown that they are more likely to overshoot when instructed
not to do so. Soccer players directed not to direct a penalty shot to a
certain corner of the net focus their gaze on that very spot. Even a
simple motor task such as holding a weight by a string is affected by
this ironic process. People instructed to avoid making the weight swing a
particular direction frequently swing the pendulum in that very
direction. The effect is more pronounced when the subject is distracted
by counting backwards at the same time.</p>

<p>Worrying is also an example of the ironic process. Try putting a worry
out of your mind when you are tired. Try forcing yourself to go to sleep
when you have a “big day tomorrow.” Try not thinking about an itch after
you have noticed it. Each of these tasks is made harder the more you try
not to focus on it.</p>

<p>Wegner points out that ironic processes do not usually control our
lives, and most of the time we do just fine suppressing unwanted
impulses, emotions, thoughts, and sensations. It is only when we are
stressed out, overloaded, or distracted, that the control breaks down and
we become like Poe’s murderer, perversely thinking about or doing the
very thing we are trying to stop. At such times we would probably do
better to stop trying so hard to control our thoughts and/or impulses, as
the urge to control them adds to the stress that lowers our control.</p>
