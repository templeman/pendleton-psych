<p>Human beings have a remarkable capacity for thought. People can think
about things even when they are doing something else quite unrelated.
This capacity allows us to be creative and solve problems, but is it
always healthy? A recent experiment by Harvard psychologists Matthew
Killingsworth and Daniel Gilbert suggests there are emotional costs to a
wandering mind. They created a website called trackyourhappiness.org at
which anyone with an iPhone can sign up and then be randomly called at
various times of the day to answer a few questions about their activities
and mood <em>at that moment</em>. This method is called “experience
sampling” and allows researchers to sample people’s thoughts in real
time. This method is a lot more reliable than asking people to complete
questionnaires at some later time (e.g., “What were you thinking about
last Thursday morning at 9 am?”) An online site also allows for much
larger sample sizes, as anyone who finds the site can sign up and become
a research subject. Subjects in this experiment were asked when they
typically wake up and go to sleep each day. Their waking hours were
divided into several time-blocks, and a random call was made in each
time-block for as long as each subject was willing to be called. To be
included in the study, you had to be available for a minimum of 50 calls.
The questions were simple and few:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How are you feeling right now? (answered on a scale of 0 [bad] to
	100 [good]</li>
	<li>What are you doing right now? (checklist of 22 categories)</li>
	<li>Are you thinking about something other than what you are currently
	doing?
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>No;</li>
		<li>Yes - something pleasant;</li>
		<li>Yes - something neutral; or</li>
		<li>Yes - something unpleasant</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Mind wandering was defined as thinking about something other than what
you are doing right now (that is, answering Yes to Question #3).</p>

<p>The authors accumulated 2,250 subjects online, all of them over 18
years of age. A little over half (58.8%) are male, and the majority (74%)
live in the United States.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>1) Mind wandering was reported by 47% of the participants, which is a
bigger proportion than what is usually found in laboratory studies of
mind wandering.</p>

<p>2) People whose minds were not wandering scored about 70 on the
Happiness scale, as did people who whose minds wandered to something
pleasant. People whose minds wandered to something unpleasant dropped to
about 40 on the Happiness scale. People whose minds wandered to a neutral
subject dropped to about 60 on the Happiness scale, suggesting that
unless you’ve got a pleasant thought to turn to, thinking about something
other than what you’re doing is going to worsen your mood. About 42% of
participants’ minds wandered to pleasant thoughts.</p> 

<p>3) The researchers also analyzed how the person’s mood or mind
wandering at one check-in time influenced mood or mind wandering at the
next check-in time. This time- lag analysis found that mind wandering was
highly correlated with negative mood at the next check-in, but that mood
was not correlated with mind wandering at the next check-in. Thus mind
wandering itself may contribute to unhappiness rather than vice
versa.</p>

<p>4) Perhaps the most important finding of this study is that what
people were thinking at the time of the check-ins was a better predictor
of mood than what they were doing. There was some effect of activities on
mood, with conversation and exercise rated about 75 on the Happiness
Scale and work rated about ten points lower, but by and large mood did
not vary much with activity, whereas it did with thoughts, and much of
the time people’s thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p>This study has implications even for those of us who don’t own
iPhones. When we are awake our minds look for something to focus on.
Where we direct our attention affects our mood. Focusing on what we are
doing at the moment – even if it is mundane, tedious, or repetitive – may
be healthier than letting our minds wander, because wandering minds tend
to go down a negative path. Once you’re on a negative thought path, it
becomes difficult to get off it. Shifting to a more pleasant thought
becomes difficult because part of your mind is still trying to shut out
the unpleasant thought, which won’t go away (see What’s New article <a
	href="the-imp-of-the-perverse">"The Imp of the Perverse."</a>)</p>

<p>By the way, anyone who wants to participate in this study can still go
to <a href="http://www.trackyourhappiness.org">trackyourhappiness.org</a>
and sign in. You might also want to study your own thoughts by
occasionally stopping in the middle of an activity, mentally stepping
back and identifying where your mind actually is. This is called a
mindfulness exercise. Are you focused on what you’re doing? If not, where
do your thoughts go? Do you naturally turn to positive thoughts, or do
you start thinking about something unpleasant?</p>
