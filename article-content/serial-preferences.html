<p>Human beings can only process so much information at a time. When
presented with a series of things to consider, our attention peaks with
the first items, then fades as the list grows longer, and peaks again
when we hear the last item. Thus when memorizing a grocery list or trying
to recall a talk we are most likely to remember the first and last items
presented. Now a group of Canadian and U.S. psychologists has
demonstrated how serial order affects our preference for things.</p>

<p>In this experiment the researchers recruited 142 college students and
members of the local community to participate in a wine tasting exercise.
Each subject was presented a series of two, three, four or five glasses
of either white or red varietals, and asked to select their favorite
wine. What the participants didn’t know was that all of the wines sampled
came from the same bottle, so they were comparing the same wine with
itself in every case. Can you guess the overwhelmingly favorite glass of
wine? If you guessed the first one, you were right. After the first
glass, each succeeding glass fell precipitously in the taste test. The
researchers then divided the participants into two groups of
knowledgeable wine tasters and naïve wine tasters and performed the same
experiment again. All of them continued to show the same preference for
the first glass, but by the fourth glass those more experienced with wine
began showing some preference for the last glass of wine, although they
still rated the first glass best. The authors concluded that wine
connoisseurs are more persistent in holding out for a possible better
tasting glass of wine when given a series of glasses from which to
choose.</p>

<p>The implications of the study go beyond wine tasting. The results
provide yet another example of people being favorably biased toward first
things experienced in a series. This may be why memories of your first
rock concert, first hunting trip, first trip to Disneyland, or first meal
at your favorite restaurant tend to stand out as more enjoyable than
later examples of the same experience. Hmmmm, maybe this study should be
repeated with speed dating...</p>
