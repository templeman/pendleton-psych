<h5>Terrel L. Templeman, Ph.D.</h5>
<p>This article is based upon basic principles of reinforcement and
research conducted by Gerald Patterson and his colleagues at the
University of Oregon and Oregon Social Learning Center. Their studies
of interactions between parents and their children for over 30 years
have demonstrated a surprising pattern of interaction between parent
and child that invariably results in worsening behavior in children and
loss of control in parents. They call this sequence The Parent Child
Coercive Cycle. It can start with either parent or child. The following
examples illustrate some variations of this cycle.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>Toby, age 13, is in his room on his Xbox 360. Mom comes in the room
and interrupts him.</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> Why aren't you doing your homework? How many times have I told
you No videogames until you do your homework! You're flunking math and here you
sit playing that stupid game!</p>

<p><b>Toby:</b> (without looking up from the game) I don't have any
homework.</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> (yelling) What do you mean you don't have any homework? Your
teachers all tell me you never turn in any work! You're not going to pass
seventh grade the way you're going!</p>

<p><b>Toby:</b> I don't understand the math we're doing and besides I forgot my
book.</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> You never bring your books home even when you have homework! How
do you expect to pass if you never bring home your books?</p>

<p><b>Toby:</b> But Mom, I don't understand the math we're doing. I hate that
class! The stupid teacher never gives me any help!</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> That's no excuse for not doing your homework. If you'd
spend as much time thinking about school as you do that game you'd get
straight A's. I'm sick and tired of you and that Xbox. Look at this
room! It's a mess. The trash needs taken out, the cat box needs
emptied, and here you sit. What would you do if your dad and I spent
all our time playing videogames? Who would get anything done around
this house? Who would bring any money home? If you think you can spend
your life playing those silly games you've got another think
coming!</p>

<p><b>Toby:</b> Dad plays videogames! You watch soap operas all
afternoon! I'll take out the trash later. It's not even my turn to
empty the cat litter. My sister never has to do anything, and she
spends all her time on her cell phone – you never get after her! I
don't care if I drop out of school! I hate school! Uncle Gus never
finished school and he makes more money than Dad.</p>

<p>Mom throws up her hands and leaves the room. Toby returns to his
game.</p>

<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>Mom and her 5 year old daughter Angie are grocery shopping. In the
cookie aisle Angie begins to beg.</p>

<p><b>Angie:</b> Mommy can I have some Oreos?</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> No Angie, we have cookies at home.</p>

<p><b>Angie:</b> (whining at the top of her voice) I want Oreos, I want
Oreos, I want Oreos!</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> (irritated but tries to keep her voice down): Angie,
you've already had ice cream today and I don't want you to spoil your
dinner.</p>

<p><b>Angie:</b> (bursting into tears, screaming repeatedly at the top
of her lungs) Mommy I want some Oreos! I want some Oreos! I want some
Oreos!</p>

<p><b>Mom:</b> Oh all right, but this is the last time I take you
shopping with me.</p>

<p>Mom puts Oreos in the basket. Angie immediately quiets down and
stops begging.</p>

<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>Dad sits down to read the newspaper after dinner. His 7 year old son
Billy and 5 year old daughter Amanda are playing in the same room.
After a few minutes Dad is aware of bickering between them. The older
boy is teasing his sister, who is squealing in protest. Their noise
level is just enough to get Dad‟s attention.</p>

<p><b>Dad:</b> (muttering from behind the paper) Billy, leave your
sister alone.</p>

<p>Dad goes back to reading. A few minutes later Dad hears Amanda
fussing louder.</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> Daddy, Billy is bothering me!</p>

<p><b>Dad:</b> (irritated) Billy, knock it off if you know what's good
for you!</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> (protesting) I wasn't doing anything! She started
it!</p>

<p>Dad goes back to his paper. Billy and Amanda continue to argue, and
Dad tries to ignore their behavior, hoping it will die down if he
doesn't pay it much attention. But Billy and Amanda get louder, until
finally Amanda screams and Billy chases her across the room,
practically tripping over Dad's feet. At this point Dad loses it,
throws down the paper, stands up, grabs Billy and gets in his face.</p>

<p><b>Dad:</b> (yelling) I told you to knock it off! Can't I have any
peace in this house?!</p>

<p>Billy is now wide-eyed with fear and immediately pipes down, lower
lip quivering. Amanda has also frozen in her tracks. Dad, suddenly
embarrassed by his own emotion, calms down, apologizes to the kids for
yelling, and leaves the room. Billy and Amanda go back to playing.</p>

<p>Before breaking down these scenarios into their component parts, it
is important to learn some principles of reinforcement.</p>

<h4>The Principles of Reinforcement</h4>
<p>Human behavior is motivated by many things, but for our purposes
there are several basics which motivate children and adults alike.</p>

<p><strong>Positive Reinforcement</strong> is <em>any consequence to an
	action that increases the likelihood that action will happen
	again</em>. Such consequences are called <em>positive
	reinforcers</em>. Positive reinforcers come in many varieties, and
what reinforces one person may not reinforce another. However, there
are basic reinforcers that work for most of us.  For example, a person
who smiles at you when you make eye contact will cause you to increase
eye contact in the course of a conversation.  Smiling and making eye
contact are simple but powerful reinforcers of social behavior.
Positive comments such as, “Good job!” or even a pat on the back will
often reinforce performance or cooperation from a child. Sweets,
treats, other material items, or privileges can also be used as
reinforcers. Positive reinforcement is strongest when it occurs just
after a behavior. It is less effective the longer it is delayed.</p>

<p><strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> is not what you think it is.
It is not punishment (e.g., spanking a child for acting out). It is not
reinforcing the “wrong” behavior (e.g., giving a child attention when
he is being “bad.”) Negative reinforcement is just as reinforcing as
positive reinforcement; that is, when it follows a behavior it will
make the behavior more likely in the future. So what is it?
<em>Negative reinforcement occurs when an action causes a painful or
	obnoxious experience to end.</em> It happens frequently in
parent-child interactions.  For example, a Dad who stops spanking his
son when he says, “I promise I'll be good!” negatively reinforces such
comments during punishment. A mom who stops lecturing her daughter when
she talks back to her negatively reinforces back talk. Kids who stop
making noise when Dad yells at them are negatively reinforcing Dad for
yelling. Once a behavior successfully stops a painful or irritating
experience, it is more likely to occur the next time the irritant
occurs. In behavioral terms, this is called escape conditioning because
the person learns to escape from the painful experience by behaving in
a certain way.</p>

<p><strong>Punishment</strong> is <em>any action that suppresses or
	decreases a behavior</em>. Such actions are unpleasant, irritating or
painful. Parents typically punish children by yelling, lecturing,
withholding privileges, removing toys, or spanking. Children can also
punish parents by such activities as yelling or arguing, name calling,
throwing temper tantrums, or breaking precious objects. Punishment is
effective in stopping certain ongoing behaviors. For example, a young
child who starts screaming in the midst of a lecture by her parent will
usually stop the lecture. Likewise a parent who swats a child's hands
when he reaches for the cookie jar will usually stop the reaching, at
least momentarily. Punishments, like reinforcers, are most effective
when they occur immediately following a behavior (or in the middle of
an ongoing behavior) and end quickly. However, there are at least four
problems with relying on punishment to manage behavior.</p>

<h4>Problems with Punishment</h4>
<ol>
	<li>It can easily escalate to the point of becoming abusive
	(name-calling, slapping, hitting).</li>
	<li>Its effects are temporary. That is, it stops the child's behavior
	only briefly, so that the same behavior will crop up again once the
	punishment is lifted or the punisher is not around.</li>
	<li>Punishment doesn't teach the child any new behaviors.</li>
	<li>Punishment leads to escape conditioning, whereby the child looks
	for any means to avoid the punishment, which sometimes leads to
	desperate actions, including aggression (see below).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Extinction</strong> is <em>the removal of
	reinforcement</em>, which is ultimately followed by a lessening of
the behavior that was previously reinforced. If you give in to your
child every time she wants something in the grocery store (positive
reinforcement) you are conditioning the child to ask for something
every time. If one day you decide not to give in to her request, you
have just shifted to a path of extinction. However, <em>the first time
	you stop reinforcing a behavior after a history of reinforcing it,
	the behavior you are trying to extinguish actually gets worse!</em> A
good example is the mother who finally refuses to give her child what
she demands in the grocery store – the little girl is likely to
increase whining and throw a bigger temper tantrum than before. This
effect may linger over a period of several more visits to the store
before the child finally stops begging for treats.</p>

<p><strong>Intermittent reinforcement</strong> is <em>the intermittent
	application of a reinforcer to a behavior, that is, it occurs only
	once in a while</em>. Suppose for example Mom in Scenario 2 resolves
to stop buying treats for Angie each time she begs for them in the
grocery store. As noted above, the first time she refuses Angie is
likely to throw a big tantrum, but after several trips without treats
the begging will begin to subside. Suppose Mom then gives in to a
modest whine for treats – next time they go to the store Angie will
resume whining and begging in full force. And she is likely to keep it
up longer even if Mom goes back to saying No. Indeed intermittent or
“once-in-a-while” reinforcement has been shown to keep a behavior going
much longer than constant reinforcement. Parents are especially prone
to reinforce behavior intermittently for a variety of reasons. First,
they sometimes forget their own rules (e.g., “No more treats for
begging!). Second, they are easily seduced by their children's toning
down the negative behavior so that they want to reinforce it. Third,
parents often tire out before a negative behavior is fully extinguished
and it seems easier to “give in” and reinforce it instead of standing
by their rules.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulus control</strong> occurs when the mere presence of a
person or object becomes associated with either positive reinforcement
or punishment. This often happens in families where one parent is
designated in charge of discipline (“wears the black hat”) and the
other is associated with more pleasant activities. After a while the
parent in charge of discipline will become so strongly associated with
punishment that the children will engage in escape tactics even when
they are not in trouble! Likewise the parent associated with positive
activities will become a magnet for the children's attention. Stimulus
control, escape conditioning, and reinforcement can combine into a
sequence of events in which neither parent nor child is really in
control of their behavior. This sequence is called the
<strong>Parent-Child Coercive Cycle</strong>. So let's go back and
analyze each of our scenarios using these principles.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<dl class="clearfix">
	<dt>Step 1.</dt>
	<dd>Mom scolds Toby</dd>
	<dd>(Mom is an irritant to Toby)</dd>
	<dt>Step 2.</dt>
	<dd>Toby attempts to ignore Mom</dd>
	<dd>(Toby attempts to extinguish scolding)</dd>
	<dt>Step 3.</dt>
	<dd>Mom increases scolding</dd>

	Mom)</dd>
	<dt>Step 5.</dt>
	<dd>Mom withdraws</dd>
	<dd>(Mom negatively reinforces arguing)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Mom's mere presence may be a negative to Toby (see <span
	class="keyword">stimulus control</span>) but her scolding is like a
<span class="keyword">punishment</span> to him. He initially tries to
ignore it with a brief comment, which is essentially an <span
	class="keyword">extinction</span> tactic, but trying to extinguish a
behavior that has been reinforced in the past will initially lead to an
escalation of it, and so Mom actually increases her scolding. At this
point Toby begins arguing back, essentially punishing Mom for scolding,
which eventually does suppress the behavior, to the point where Mom
leaves the scene. Mom's departure <span class="keyword">negatively
	reinforces</span> Toby's arguing, making it more likely he will argue
with her the next time she comes to scold. Also notice how the original
goal of getting Toby to do homework is lost in this sequence.</p>

<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<dl class="clearfix">
	<dt>Step 1.</dt>
	<dd>Angie begs Mom</dd>
	<dd>(Angie is an irritant to Mom)</dd>
	<dt>Step 2.</dt>

	<dd>(Mom positively reinforces begging)</dd>
	<dt>Step 5.</dt>
	<dd>Angie quiets down</dd>
	<dd>(Angie negatively reinforces Mom’s compliance)</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this scenario Angie begins the sequence by begging for cookies in
the grocery store. Mom attempts to stop the begging by saying No, but
the begging escalates to a painful level for Mom, effectively <span
	class="keyword">punishing</span> her for saying No. Mom finally
capitulates by giving Angie the cookies, which <span
	class="keyword">positively reinforces</span> Angie for making a scene
in the grocery store. Then Angie quiets down, which <span
	class="keyword">negatively reinforces</span> Mom for giving in. It is
this last step which makes the entire scenario more likely to happen
again the next time Mom and Angie go shopping.</p>

<h4>Scenario 3</h4>

	<dd>(Dad negatively reinforces kids)</dd>
	<dt>Step 11.</dt>
	<dd>Dad gives kids attention</dd>
	<dd>(Dad positively reinforces the entire scenario)</dd>
</dl>

<p>The first sequence begins with the children making noise while Dad
is trying to read the paper. Dad's presence may be reinforcing to them
(see <span class="keyword">stimulus control</span>), perhaps because he
sometimes plays with them (see <span class="keyword">intermittent
	reinforcement</span>), or perhaps they don‟t see much of Dad during
the day, so his presence is highly valued. Eventually they succeed in
getting his attention. Dad's first comments are too mild to be a
punishment and he <span class="keyword">positively reinforces</span>
Amanda for telling on her brother. In Step 3 Amanda successfully gets
more of Dad's attention by complaining about Billy in a loud voice. Dad
responds by scolding Billy, a <span class="keyword">punishment</span>.
Billy responds to Dad's attack with a counterattack, which <span
	class="keyword">punishes</span> Dad, who retreats back to the paper
(see <span class="keyword">escape conditioning</span>), allowing both
children to escalate their behavior. In Step 7 Amanda‟s screaming and
Billy‟s reaction to it push Dad over the top, and his shouting suddenly
becomes <span class="keyword">punishing</span> enough to get both kids
to stop what they are doing, which <span
	class="keyword">reinforces</span> Dad for shouting at them. Dad is
now embarrassed about losing his temper, calms himself down and
apologizes. His departure <span class="keyword">reinforces</span> the
entire sequence so that it is more likely to follow the same course in
the future. An alternative ending might have Dad apologize and then get
down on the floor to play with Billy and Amanda, to “make it up to
them.” While this sounds like a happy ending (“All's well that ends
well”), this kind of <span class="keyword">positive
	reinforcement</span> at the end of a series of confrontations also
makes the sequence more likely to occur again next time, the lesson
being that no matter how mad Dad gets, it will end in a happy
moment.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the examples above, the Parent Child Coercive
Cycle can start with either the child or the adult making a demand on
the other, which leads to arguing, which suppresses the original demand
or escalates to the point where someone gets mad and the other submits,
reinforcing the person who either gets mad first or who becomes the
most intimidating, who then calms down enough to reinforce the other
for submitting. In both cases the participants feel helpless to do
anything different, and the entire exchange is reinforced at the end
either negatively (by the other party withdrawing) or positively (by
getting what they demanded) or both. This pattern is especially
dangerous in families prone to domestic violence, where neither child
nor adult submit until physically attacked. Even then the pattern is
“locked in” by the submission that ends it in negative
reinforcement.</p>

<h4>Breaking the Cycle</h4>
<p>The best approach to breaking the cycle is to not start it. Let's go
back to Mom and Toby.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>It may seem logical to ask Toby to get off the Xbox and do his
homework, but when parent and child have been through this scenario a
few times, starting with a demand will lead right back into the cycle,
especially if the parent is strongly associated with punishment in the
child's mind. In fact, approaching Toby at all when he is already on
the Xbox primes him to ignore or rebut anything Mom might say (another
example of <span class="keyword">stimulus control</span>). The fact
that Toby is already on the game when Mom comes in the room gives him
the upper hand. Mom could give herself the advantage if she confiscated
the Xbox before Toby comes home from school. When Toby asks what
happened to his game, Mom can tell him he can have it when he shows her
some finished homework. If Toby hasn't brought any books home from
school, Mom can keep the game until he chooses to do so, maybe
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Now let's suppose Toby decides to argue with Mom about it right
then. Recall that arguing is a <span class="keyword">punishing
	strategy</span> designed to get Mom to back down and give him the
Xbox. What should Mom do? If she starts arguing back he will increase
his arguing, and they will be right back in the coercive cycle. So
let's encourage Mom to try something different – removing herself from
Toby. She can do this by going to some other room, going outside, or
even leaving the house (provided the Xbox is not accessible in her
absence). <em>The key is to stop interacting with the child at that
	point.</em> It takes two to argue, and without a partner Toby has to
find something else to do. Mom's departure is also a way to extinguish
Toby's arguing, so we have to remember what happens the first time Mom
tries to extinguish a previously learned behavior. Toby may react by
escalating his arguing. He may even follow Mom around the house to try
to keep her engaged in the argument. Or in extreme cases he may become
threatening or even violent toward her. If Mom gives in and
relinquishes the Xbox she will reinforce his escalation, making it more
likely he will go to that extreme in the future. If she cannot easily
remove herself from the arguing, what's a mother to do?</p>

<h4>De-escalating the angry child through behavior shaping</h4>
<p>Behavior shaping is <em>the use of positive reinforcement and
	extinction to modify behavior a little at a time</em>. In the case of
Toby following Mom to argue with her, she needs him to do two things:
1) Quiet down, and 2) Leave her alone. To achieve either of these goals
Mom must first <em>calm herself down</em> (see <a
	href="#emotional-preparation">The Importance of Emotional
	Preparation</a> below). Once calm herself, Mom can look for pauses in
Toby's arguing and <span class="keyword">reinforce</span> them with a
positive response, such as respectful attention or acknowledging his
feelings about the Xbox (without giving in to him). <em>At the same
	time she does not want to respond to his arguing, even if it rises to
	the level of threats, foul language, or loud voice.</em> Demanding
that he show respect or countering his threats with her own threats
will only lead back down the coercive path to a bad ending. Instead,
she is better off not attending to his threats or abusive comments at
all (<span class="keyword">extinction</span>). To achieve separation
she can break off eye contact and turn to leave, saying nothing. If he
does not follow her she can say something positive, like, “Good. Once
you‟ve had time to calm down we'll talk about this some more,” then
leave the scene. If he continues to follow her, she can turn back, make
eye contact, say, “Not now,” then leave again. Eventually Toby will
leave or go to his room. Once he stops following <em>it is important
	not turn around and follow him or to try to have “the last word” with
	him</em>, which will only reignite the argument.</p>

<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>Let's now take a look at Scenario 2. Angie begs Mom for cookies in
the grocery store. Mom says No and Angie increases her whining. As we
have seen, arguing with Angie will lead down the coercive pathway.
Suppose Mom just says No once and moves away from the cookie aisle.
Angie may continue whining, but without the temptation of cookie
packages staring her in the face (<span
	class="keyword">stimulus</span>) she may get distracted and calm down
about cookies. On the other hand, if she is used to getting her way in
the grocery store she may increase her whining (See Step 3 of this
scenario). <em>At this point it is important that Mom not start arguing
	with Angie.</em> Instead, suppose she keeps quiet, ignoring the
behavior altogether as she moves on to the next aisle. Of course Mom
also has to ignore the attention of other shoppers as Angie keeps
making a fuss (see <a href="#emotional-preparation">The Importance of
	Emotional Preparation</a> below). Once Angie begins to calm down Mom
can attend to her again, with <span class="keyword">positive
	reinforcement</span>, such as a brief “Good girl,” or some soothing
physical contact, such as taking her hand or stroking her hair. Or she
may engage Angie in some joint decision making, such as, “Hey, what do
you think we should we fix for dinner tonight?” If Angie engages, Mom
stays engaged and talking with her, <em>but without bringing up
	cookies.</em> If Angie brings up cookies or goes back to pouting, Mom
disengages and ignores the behavior.</p>

<p>Suppose Mom decides to remove Angie from the store when she starts
fussing, with statements like, “That's it! We're leaving. This is the
last time I take you shopping with me!” While this approach does save
Mom embarrassment in the store and keeps her from giving in to the
child's demands, there are several problems with it.</p>

<h4>Problems with Taking Angie Out of the Store</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Removing Angie may not stop the arguing but may instead transfer
	it from the store to the car.</li>
	<li>Mom forfeits a shopping trip, which can be costly if she needed
	the groceries for dinner that night.</li>
	<li>The cookie problem will likely come back during the next shopping
	trip. Remember that removing Angie from the store is basically a
	punishment, which may suppress her whining about cookies at the time
	but will have little lasting impact. Threats by parents to “never
	take you shopping with me again” are rarely carried out, and so the
	next time Mom takes Angie to the store she is still going to beg and
	whine.</li>
	<li>Most important for Angie's development, <em>it prevents her from
		learning how to control her demands for immediate
		gratification.</em> Children don't just naturally stop demanding as
	they grow older. They have to learn how to do it, and such training
	works best when their parents start early. The grocery store is
	actually a wonderful place to practice checking impulses in the face
	of temptation. Modeling and behavior shaping by parents are two of
	the best ways to train children in this very important skill. Parents
	may think they are doing their children a favor by keeping them from
	such temptations, but without them children don't get a chance to
	either see how it's done or practice doing it themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Modeling</strong> is <em>the demonstration of a behavior by
	another person</em>. Believe it or not, children acquire most of
their behaviors by watching their parents, especially during their
early years, before peer influences take over. From the first eye
contact of a newborn to their first steps or their first words,
children observe closely what their parents are doing and mimic those
behaviors. The effects of modeling by parents require no outside
reinforcement.  Children just start doing what they see their parents
do. This can sometimes be embarrassing for parents who don‟t realize
how closely they are being watched. However, when they are mindful of
what they are doing, modeling is also a powerful tool for parents to
shape the behavior of their children.</p>

<h4>Modeling Impulse Control for Angie</h4>
<p>Suppose before they even get to the cookie aisle, Mom shares her
thinking aloud as she goes down the aisles: “Let's see, we need
potatoes, lettuce, and tomatoes. Mmmm those avocadoes look good but
they're awfully expensive and we don‟t need them so I'm going to pass
on those today.” Or “We need bread. Mmm those sweet rolls look good but
Mommy doesn't need sweets” as she walks by. By the time they get to the
cookie aisle, they may even look at cookies together, with Mom
commenting, “Do we have sweets at home or should we look at the
cookies? Do you think we could find some other sweet things to eat in
the store that didn't have so much sugar and fat? Let's go look at the
fruit and see what we can find.”</p>

<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>Let's face it. Children can be irritating and get on parents'
nerves. Such irritation is not unusual, nor is it a sign of bad
parenting. However, irritation can easily lead down the coercive
parent-child path without a plan to divert from it. In the case of
Billy, Amanda, and Dad, they have likely been down this path many times
before. So what might Dad do to reverse it? First let's assume that
Dad's presence itself is somewhat reinforcing to the children; that is,
Billy and Amanda like being around him (<span class="keyword">stimulus
	control</span>). If Dad were scary or mean all the time they would
avoid him when he enters the room. Is there any way Dad can use his
presence as a <span class="keyword">positive reinforcer</span> for
quiet play? Suppose the kids are relatively quiet when he first enters
the room. Before they begin to get noisy he could reinforce them by
showing them some attention, e.g., by asking, “How's the day going?”
or, “So what's been happening with you guys today?” These comments are
not only reinforcing but are likely to prompt positive responses from
them to approach and talk. Billy and Amanda may compete for attention,
but a few words of direction, such as, “One at a time, I'm not going
anywhere,” keeps the mood positive and assures each will get some
attention. Sometimes when children get adult attention they soon run
out of things to talk about, at which point Dad can move to the paper,
perhaps with a prompt, such as, “OK, Dad needs to read the paper for a
while. You kids can go back to your playing.” Let's suppose the kids
are quiet for a few minutes and then start to bicker. Dad has already
given them attention for being quiet, and he doesn't want to give them
attention for bickering, so what should he do? The simplest solution is
to get up and <em>leave without saying anything</em>. Dad's presence is
like oxygen. The bickering is like a small flame in a big pile of
kindling. Cut off the oxygen and the flame goes out (<span
	class="keyword">extinction</span>). If Billy and Amanda go back to
playing quietly Dad can re-enter the room and read the paper. In this
way his presence reinforces playing quietly and his absence
extinguishes bickering. However, sometimes the flame may follow the
oxygen, and so Dad (like Mom in Scenario 1) may not be able to find a
place where he will be left alone. In this case, a more structured form
of extinction called <span class="keyword">Time Out</span> may be
necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Time Out</strong> is the <em>removal of a child from
	reinforcement for a specified period of time.</em> Because it forces
the child to leave a desired space or activity, Time Out is also a kind
of punishment for the child. For it to be effective Time Out must
follow certain rules.</p>

<h4>Rules for Time Out</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The Time Out area should be less reinforcing than the area from
	which the child just left. If Billy would rather be on the Play
	Station in his room than playing with his sister, sending him to his
	room actually reinforces his bickering with her.</li>
	<li>Time Out should only last long enough to stop the disruptive
	behavior. Five to ten minutes is sufficient for most children. Like
	other forms of punishment, Time Out does not teach the child how to
	behave but merely stops the action altogether and gives the various
	players (in this case Billy, Amanda, and Dad) time to calm down and
	try something different.</li>
	<li>Time Out is not effective if it is accompanied by yelling,
	lecturing, or other interactions with the parent. It requires
	separating the child from the parent and from other children.</li>
	<li>Time Out loses its effectiveness if the parent forgets the time.
	For this reason I recommend an automatic timer that will ring or
	chirp when the time is over. Timers are impersonal and make it less
	likely the children will call to parents asking, “Can I come out
	now?” or “What time is it?”</li>
</ol>

<p>How might <span class="keyword">Time Out</span> work in Scenario 3?
Dad sits down to read the paper and the kids begin bickering. It is too
late to give them positive attention, as they are already acting up,
and he doesn't want to leave the room where he has his favorite chair.
Dad puts down his paper, gets out of his chair, and tells Billy and
Amanda to go to their rooms while he is reading the paper. Amanda
starts crying and Billy starts arguing, “But Dad, I wasn't doing
anything! She started it first!” etc. <em>Without engaging in
	discussion</em> Dad escorts Billy and Amanda to their respective
rooms and tells them, “The timer is set for 5 minutes. When it rings
you can come out and try again to be quiet.” Dad returns to his chair
and reads the paper. There is no need for Dad to respond to the timer
himself as long as Billy and Amanda can hear it.</p>

<h4>Summary of the Coercive Parent Child Cycle</h4>
<p>By now you may have noticed there is a final common pathway for all
of these coercive interactions, which usually start in one of two
ways:</p>

<dl class="clearfix">
	<dt>A)</dt>
	<dd>Parent gives a directive that is ignored by the child. Examples:
	“Do your homework.” “Get off the computer.” “Clean your room.” “Stop
	bothering your sister.” “Don't speak to me that way!”</dd>
	<dt>B)</dt>
	<dd>Child makes a demand that parent rejects. Examples: “I want
	cookies!” “Give me back my computer!” “I need my allowance right
	now!” “I want my cell phone! I bought it with my own money!” “I have
	to go over to Jimmy's house.”</dd>
</dl>

	<p>Each scenario leads to one person attacking the other. The party
	feeling attacked tries to escape the punishment by counter-attacking,
	which punishes the attacker. This back and forth attack and
	counter-attack goes on for a while, with each side escalating, until
	one party reaches a level of punishment severe enough to finally
	suppress the counter-attack of the other. Once one party finally
	gives in or backs off, the cycle ends in reinforcing the attacker,
	who is more likely to engage in the same behavior next time. If the
	entire sequence ends with both persons making up and apologizing, the
	entire sequence is more likely to occur again.</p>

	<p>These two versions of the Parent Child Coercive Cycle are
	presented here in diagram form:</p>

	<h4>Summary of Breaking the Cycle</h4>
	<h5>Parent Directs Child</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Parent gives a direction which child ignores.</li>
		<li>Parent stops talking, leaves, removes a reinforcer (e.g., turns
		off videogame), or removes child from reinforcement (e.g., moves
		away from cookie aisle, puts child in Time Out).</li>
		<li>Once child begins to comply, parent behaves positively, speaks
		positively, or provides some other reinforcements (behavior
		shaping).</li>
	</ol>

	<h5>Parent Responds to Child</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Child makes demand that parent rejects. Child acts out or tries
		to argue.</li>
		<li>Parent stops talking, leaves, removes a reinforcer, or puts
		child in Time Out.</li>
		<li>Once child calms down, parent behaves positively, speaks
		positively, or provides some other reinforcement.</li>
		<li>Once child stops arguing, parent makes counter offer to child's
		request, staying engaged with child as long as child stays
		calm.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Fewer words have greater impact</h4>
	<p>Parents sometimes believe that they must explain the reasons
	behind every discipline they give. This belief often leads to
	lecturing, which causes most children to stop listening almost as
	soon as parents start talking. Talking louder or with more force
	causes the child to pay attention to the emotion of the message, not
	the content. Even monotone lecturing is irritating to children (and
	most adults too) and thus serves as a form of punishment. Children
	try to escape from it by tuning it out, arguing back, or creating a
	disturbance to stop it. Thus lecturing can easily lead to the
	coercive cycle we have been discussing. During discipline words have
	the greatest impact when they are brief, to the point and direct.
	Stick to the issue at hand and avoid going off on tangents.  For
	example, compare Mom's speech in Scenario 1 with the following
	alternative:</p>

	<p>Mom enters room.</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> Toby, turn off the Xbox.</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> Mom, just a few more minutes, I'm almost done.</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> Turn off the Xbox now.</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> But Mom, I'm right in the middle of the game! Can't
	you at least give me five minutes?</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> No. Turn off the game now.</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> I'm almost up to Level 5. Just give me 5 more
	minutes!</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> That's it. No TV tonight.</p>

	<p>Mom leaves room.</p>

	<h4 id="emotional-preparation">The importance of emotional
		preparation</h4>
	<p>In any conflict between two persons the calmer person will usually
	prevail. Nowhere is this dictum more pertinent than in interactions
	between parents and their children. Indeed the child who can push the
	parent to lose emotional control has a powerful advantage over the
	parent. Thus one of the most important goals for parents in breaking
	the coercive cycle is to <em>stay calm and not react emotionally to
		the child</em>. Unfortunately this is also one of the most
	difficult tasks for parents who regularly get into these exchanges
	with their children.  The coercive cycle primes children and parents
	to react to each other emotionally. Both sides can feel the tension,
	consisting of both fear and anger, which builds as soon as it gets
	started. Indeed emotional intensity may be mutually reinforcing, with
	each person bringing out strong feelings in the other. In this way
	parents can sometimes get trapped in their own emotions and find
	themselves helpless to stay calm.</p>

	<p>Having a second parent in the home who can step in when one parent
	is feeling emotionally trapped can be very helpful, as long as the
	second parent can stay calm and has the same behavioral goal for the
	child as the first parent. When only one parent is available to deal
	with the child, it is important to prepare oneself emotionally before
	approaching the child. Here are some tips for staying calm:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Stay focused on the behavior goal (e.g., Homework first, Xbox
		later).</li>
		<li>Anticipate the child's reaction to your behavior (e.g., He's
		going to blow up when he can't find his Xbox).</li>
		<li>Have a plan for dealing with the reaction. Such a plan may
		simply be a look or a brief instruction to “Calm yourself down.”
		For more violent reactions the plan may require calling in the
		support of another adult or having an exit strategy.</li>
		<li>Take a deep breath before your encounter. Keep your voice low
		and measured when talking. Take your time in responding to your
		child's comments.</li>
		<li>Rehearse what you intend to say ahead of time.</li>
		<li>Talk yourself through the encounter (e.g., “I can do this. If I
		stay calm he'll calm down. He's not going to sidetrack me from
		this. I can stand my ground on this one.”</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Using negative reinforcement to get a positive result</h4>
	<p>So far we have considered the negative impact of negative
	reinforcement. Can it ever be used to a parent's advantage? Let's go
	back to Toby and Mom. Suppose she hasn't taken the Xbox away but
	wants Toby off it. She enters his room while he is happily firing
	away at alien zombies. Instead of telling him to get off the
	computer, suppose she comes up next to him, perhaps even leans
	against him a little bit with her body and starts asking questions
	about the game.</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> Show me how this game works. I've never understood the
	fascination you boys have with shooting zombies. What's that one
	doing over there?</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> Mom, Get out of my room! You're making me lose
	points!</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> Oh, don't mind me. I'm just trying to see what all the
	fuss is about. Oh, that's an ugly one! So how do you earn points on
	this?  I don't understand this at all. O my! look at all that blood
	and gore! My goodness what a past-time! In my day we played checkers,
	or maybe Cowboys and Indians, but I don't know what we'd've done
	with a game like this.</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> Mom, I can't concentrate if you're gonna stand there
	and look over my shoulder!  Please go!</p>

	<p><b>Mom:</b> Well this is the only time I ever get to see you, so
	I'm interested in how this works. Don't mind me, I'll just stand here
	and watch and see if I can figure this out.  Maybe your Dad will want
	to shoot some zombies tonight after supper. We sure didn't have games
	quite this noisy. What's that one doing over there? My God that's an
	ugly one. If you wanted a mystery in my day, we would play Clue. Now
	there's a game with some skill. There was Colonel Mustard, Miss
	Scarlet…etc. etc. etc.</p>

	<p><b>Toby:</b> Aaagh! I just got killed! I can't play this with you
	in here!  Toby leaves.</p>

	<p>If Mom's presence is sufficiently irritating to Toby, he will
	initially try to punish her by arguing and telling her to get out of
	his room. It is important for Mom to remain unfazed by his reaction
	to her, or else they will slide into the coercive cycle of attack and
	react. A comment like, “Oh, don't mind me, I'll just watch while you
	play” lets him know Mom isn't there for an argument. It is also
	important not to be positively reinforcing. For example, if Toby
	thinks it might be cool to explain the game to Mom then her presence
	is going to keep him at it. The key for Mom is to be calm – even
	cheerful – but just irritating enough that Toby will look for some
	way to exit her presence. At that moment Mom should let Toby leave
	without further comment and not follow him or keep up the talk, as
	she has succeeded in getting him off the computer. Getting off the
	computer is the first step in shaping his behavior toward homework.
	Coming into his room each afternoon at the time she would like to get
	him to do homework will eventually cause him to avoid going on the
	computer at that time (so as to avoid Mom), which makes him free to
	do something else. If he happens to bring home a book after school
	Mom can then use positive reinforcement (“I have some cookies in the
	freezer. Want me to heat some up while you study?”) to reinforce the
	studying.</p>

	<p>Notice that parents are sometimes sources of positive
	reinforcement and sometimes sources of negative reinforcement for
	their children. In either case parents have some leverage to modify
	the child's behavior. When the child is vying for their attention,
	their presence can be used to reinforce desired behavior. When the
	child finds their presence irritating, removing themselves can also
	be used to reinforce desired behavior.</p>
