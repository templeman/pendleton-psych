<p>Videogame use by children and adolescents has risen dramatically in
recent years, to the point where people are beginning to worry about the
possibility of addiction to these electronic gadgets. Now Douglas
Gentile, a psychologist at Iowa State University, has conducted the
largest survey yet of gaming habits of 8 to 18 year olds (1,178 kids) in
the United States. The results are interesting.</p>

<p>88% of those surveyed play videogames at least occasionally, with an
average of 3 to 4 times per week.</p>

<p>The average amount of playing time is 13.2 hours per week, with boys
playing more than girls (16.4 hours per week compared to 9.2 hours per
week).</p> 

<p>12 to 14 year olds engage in videogame playing more than 8 to 11 year
olds and 15 to 18 year olds.</p>

<p>Dr. Gentile also created a scale of Pathological Game Playing based
upon criteria he borrowed from Gambling Addiction. He decided 6 out of 10
of these “symptoms” would meet criteria for pathological game playing.
Below are the criteria:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Spending more and more time playing and thinking about
	videogames</li>
	<li>Needing more game time to feel the same level of excitement about
	the game</li>
	<li>Unsuccessful attempts to cut back or stop videogame playing</li>
	<li>Feeling restless or irritable when having to stop the game</li>
	<li>Using videogames as a way to escape from problems or bad
	feelings</li>
	<li>Lying to family or friends about how much time is spent gaming</li>
	<li>Stealing videogames from stores or friends</li>
	<li>Skipping responsibilities (chores, homework) in order to play
	videogames</li>
	<li>Doing poorly in school because of time spent on videogames</li>
	<li>Looking for extra sources of money (e.g. asking others for cash) to
	buy more videogames</li>
</ol>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>About 8.5% of those surveyed met the criteria for pathological gaming.
Those who scored high on pathological gaming did not as a group score
higher on amount of time spent playing videogames. Twice as many
pathological gamers were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder as non-pathological gamers.</p>

<p>These criteria may be used to determine if someone has a videogame
addiction.</p>
