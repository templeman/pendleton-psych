<p>Depression is a mood disorder that affects about 7% of the U.S.
population. Typical symptoms include feeling so sad or empty that you
can’t shake the feeling. When you’re clinically depressed, it’s hard to
get to sleep or stay asleep at night, and you may lose your appetite.
Normally pleasurable activities are no longer fun. You have little
energy to get things started, and you lack motivation to get things
done. You stop participating in activities and tend to withdraw from
friends and family. You may stay home from work or skip school. The
future starts to look hopeless and you feel helpless to do anything
about it. Ultimately you feel worthless as a human being. When these
symptoms persist life no longer seems worth living, and you start
thinking about suicide.</p>

<p>Depression is caused by a combination of factors. Certain genetic
factors raise the risk for depression, and it definitely runs in
families. Depressed persons typically have lower levels of certain
neurotransmitters (the chemicals that fire neurons in your brain) that
affect emotions and behavior, and this brain chemistry may well be
inherited. Stressful life events such as personal loss or trauma can
also lead to depression, by altering the expression of genes that
affect brain chemistry and also by producing stress hormones that
affect emotions. Some personality types are also prone to depression
due to repeated habits of thinking and behaving that lead to failure
experiences and low levels of reinforcement. No single combination of
factors is exactly the same for everybody, and thus the course of
depression and its symptom pattern will vary from person to person.</p>

<p>Depression involves how you think, act, and feel. Typically when you
are depressed you don’t merely feel sad but rather flat or empty,
unable to feel a wide range of emotions. Behaviorally you slow down and
take longer to get things done. Your attention and focus become narrow,
and you spend more time ruminating about your problems or your
failures. You become more rigid in your thinking and unable to generate
new ideas when problem solving. You are also more likely to discount
other people’s ideas as being unworkable.</p>

<p><strong>The good news</strong> is that there are effective
treatments for depression.  Such treatments include medications,
behavioral activation, and psychotherapy. Medications typically help
restore neurotransmitters or hormone levels to a normal range.
Behavioral activation refers to strategies that increase activity and
energy (through aerobic or other exercise) and expose you to more
pleasurable activities. Psychotherapy involves challenging maladaptive
thinking patterns, increasing meaningful interactions with other
people, and refocusing attention on here-and-now experiences
(mindfulness) and away from the “mental ruts” that are a hallmark of
depressed thinking.</p>

<p>Psychological Services of Pendleton, LLC, offers all three
modalities of treatment. We can also refer you to other treatment
