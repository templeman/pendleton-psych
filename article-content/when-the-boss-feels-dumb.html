<p>Ever wonder why people in power sometimes turn aggressive toward their
underlings? If they’re already in charge, what would make them
aggressive?	A series of recent studies by psychologists from University
of Southern California and University of California at Berkeley suggests
that feelings of incompetence by persons in power may fuel aggressive
tendencies toward others.</p>

<p><strong>In Study #1</strong> ninety professionals from around the USA
were invited to participate in a study while on their computers at their
offices. They first indicated on a scale just how much authority they
have over other persons in their employment. Then they completed measures
of perceived incompetence (Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale) and
aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire). Those who reported a
lot of control over other people <em>and also</em> scored high on fear of
negative evaluation scored higher on the measure of aggression.</p>

<p><strong>In Study #2</strong> ninety-eight professionals were recruited
in the same format. Some of the participants were primed to feel powerful
by writing about a time when they were in a high power role. Others were
asked to write about what they did the day before. Some of each of these
groups were asked to further write about a time when they felt especially
competent. Others were asked to write about a time when they felt
especially incompetent. Next the experimenters asked all four groups
(high power-high competence, high power-low competence, low power-high
competence, low power-low competence) to select noise blast levels for
use in a future learning experiment with other subjects. Participants
primed to recall high power but low competence memories chose much higher
blast levels than any of the other three groups.</p> 

<p><strong>In Study #3</strong> fifty-nine university students were asked
to assume the role of teacher to a student who would do various tasks for
them. They were then given positive, neutral or negative feedback about
their “leadership aptitude.” Following this feedback from the researchers
some of them were also given a “leadership aptitude test” and told they
did quite well, thus boosting their sense of competence. Finally, all the
“teachers” were told their “student” partners would be given a chance to
win extra money by completing a task. The “teacher” could choose between
an easy and a difficult task for the student to complete. Those
“teachers” who had been given negative feedback about their leadership
ability were much more likely to pick a difficult task for their student
partners than those given positive feedback about their leadership.
However, those “teachers” given negative feedback but who then were told
they did well on the aptitude test for leadership were less likely to
pick hard tasks for their students.</p>

<p><strong>In Study #4</strong> one hundred sixty-three professionals
were recruited online to describe the specific demands of their jobs
after completing a measure of the power level of their jobs. Some of them
were also asked to recall a time when they were unable to meet the
demands of their jobs. Some of them were then asked to pick a core
personal value and write about why that value is important to them (a
task that has previously been shown to boost self-worth). All
participants then completed the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. As
you might guess by now, those in high power jobs who recalled a time when
they didn’t meet the demands of the job very well scored higher on the
aggression scale than those who weren’t made to remember past
incompetence. However, those that wrote self-affirming paragraphs about
important personal goals did not score as high on aggression.</p>

<p>So what do these studies tell us about people in power? As the authors
put it, “Power holders who do not feel personally competent are more
likely than those who feel competent to lash out against other people.”
There’s something about being in charge and not feeling competent that
brings out the worst in people. Note also that all it takes to make
bosses aggressive is for them to feel incompetent, which may occur when
they feel criticized or are reminded of a time when they couldn’t meet
the demands of the job. Those in lower power positions might do well to
note when and where their bosses become aggressive. It may be those
situations where the high power people tend to feel “over their heads” or
just plain incompetent. Some personal affirmation or a little positive
feedback might just improve the situation for everyone!</p>
