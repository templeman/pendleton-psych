<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>Many of our most notable insights and emotional experiences happen during the course of our relationships. This is particularly true of our first relationships. Our first encounter with the way another person views us, is often so important that it can affect our image of ourselves for the rest of our lives. Over time we tend to internalize those experiences even if they are no longer true. Often, much of what we think about becomes automatic, leaving us ignorant to why we do the things we do.</p>
<p>One goal of therapy is to give you more insight into what until now may have been mostly by messages that are motivated by past learning and observations, often without our conscious knowledge. With this new insight, you will be able to make conscious choices, instead of merely acting out of habit.</p>
<p>Another goal of therapy is to provide a different kind of relationship, one where you can experience yourself in new and more positive ways.</p>


<h3>My Approach</h3>
<p>I offer an integrative approach to the therapeutic relationship because not all people fit into a set of theories or techniques. I pull from a variety of approaches in an attempt to fit closely with how change works for you.</p>
<p>The therapy relationship offers the chance to better understand yourself and how you relate to others. The focus is uniquely on you, which means that unlike casual discussions with friends, you don’t have the distraction of trying to manage someone else’s difficulties as well as your own. In the therapy session, we are wondering together how to solve your problems and make sense of your life. I believe that when we feel deeply understood and connected to someone else, change is possible.</p>
